    # However, the new tools should be used as soon as they are installed.
    # By switching off the hash function, the shell will always search the PATH when a program is to be run.
    # As such, the shell will find the newly compiled tools in $LFS/tools as soon as they are available
    # without remembering a previous version of the same program in a different location.

    # new files will end up with permission mode 644 and directories with mode 755).
    #
    # The LC_ALL variable controls the localization of certain programs, making their messages follow the conventions of a specified country.

_lfs_get_target_triplets() {
    set -e

    # Before continuing, be aware of the name of the working platform, often referred to as the target triplet.
    # A simple way to determine the name of the target triplet is to run the config.guess script that comes with the source for many packages.

    # Some key technical points of how the Chapter 5 build method works:
    # 
    # * Slightly adjusting the name of the working platform, by changing the "vendor" field target triplet by way of the LFS_TGT variable,
    #   ensures that the first build of Binutils and GCC produces a compatible cross-linker and cross-compiler.
    #   Instead of producing binaries for another architecture, the cross-linker and cross-compiler will produce binaries compatible with the current hardware.
    # 
    # * The temporary libraries are cross-compiled.
    #   Because a cross-compiler by its nature cannot rely on anything from its host system,
    #   this method removes potential contamination of the target system by lessening the chance
    #   of headers or libraries from the host being incorporated into the new tools.
    #   Cross-compilation also allows for the possibility of building both 32-bit and 64-bit libraries on 64-bit capable hardware.
    # 
    # * Careful manipulation of the GCC source tells the compiler which target dynamic linker will be used.

    # per https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.65/html_node/Specifying-Target-Triplets.html
    # "target triplet" has the form: ‘cpu-vendor-os’, where os can be ‘system’ or ‘kernel-system’
    #
    # examples:
    #     x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
    #     ====== == ===== ===
    #       |    |    |    '-- system
    #       |    |    '------- kernel
    #       |    '------------ vender
    #       '----------------- cpu
    #
    # chapter5 changes the "vendor" field to "lfs" and the target triplet is x86_64-lfs-linux-gnu

    # 
    # Binutils is installed first because
    #     the "configure runs" of both GCC and Glibc perform various feature tests on the assembler and linker
    #     to determine which software features to enable or disable.
    # This is more important than one might first realize.
    # An incorrectly configured GCC or Glibc can result in a subtly broken toolchain,
    # where the impact of such breakage might not show up until near the end of the build of an entire distribution.
    # A test suite failure will usually highlight this error before too much additional work is performed.

    # Binutils installs its assembler and linker in two locations,
    #     /tools/bin
    # and
    #     /tools/$LFS_TGT/bin
    # . The tools in one location are hard linked to the other.

    # An important facet of the linker is its library search order.
    # Detailed information can be obtained from ld by passing it the --verbose flag.
    #
    # For example, an
    #     ld --verbose | grep SEARCH
    # will illustrate the current search paths and their order.
    #
    # It shows "which files are linked by ld" by compiling a dummy program and passing the --verbose switch to the linker.
    #           ============================     -------------------------     ------------------------------------------
    # For example,
    #     gcc dummy.c -Wl,--verbose 2>&1 | grep succeeded
    # will show all the files successfully opened during the linking.

# 6.10. Adjusting the Toolchain

_lfs_basic_system_adjust_toolchain() {
    # Now that the final C libraries have been installed, it is time to adjust the toolchain so that it will link any newly compiled program against these new libraries.

    # First, backup the /tools linker, and replace it with the adjusted linker we made in chapter 5.
    # We'll also create a link to its counterpart in /tools/$(uname -m)-pc-linux-gnu/bin:
    mv -v /tools/bin/{ld,ld-old}
    mv -v /tools/$(uname -m)-pc-linux-gnu/bin/{ld,ld-old}
    mv -v /tools/bin/{ld-new,ld}
    ln -sv /tools/bin/ld /tools/$(uname -m)-pc-linux-gnu/bin/ld

    # Next, amend the GCC specs file so that it points to the new dynamic linker.
    # Simply deleting all instances of “/tools” should leave us with the correct path to the dynamic linker.
    # Also adjust the specs file so that GCC knows where to find the correct headers and Glibc start files.

    # of the adjusted toolchain are working as expected.

    echo -e "\033[1;32mfound ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 at /lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2\033[0m"

    # If the output does not appear as shown above or is not received at all, then something is seriously wrong.
    # Investigate and retrace the steps to find out where the problem is and correct it.
    # The most likely reason is that something went wrong with the specs file adjustment.
    # Any issues will need to be resolved before continuing with the process.

    # Once everything is working correctly, clean up the test files:
    rm -v dummy.c a.out dummy.log

    If you are building for 32-bit x86, but you have a CPU which is capable of running 64-bit code

    Shadow'"'"'s stock configuration for the useradd utility has a few caveats that need some explanation.\n
    - First, the default action for the useradd utility is to create the user and a group of the same name as the user.\n
      By default the user ID (UID) and group ID (GID) numbers will begin with 1000.\n
      This means if you dont pass parameters to useradd, each user will be a member of a unique group on the system.\n
    If this behavior is undesirable, youll need to pass the -g parameter to useradd.\n
    The default parameters are stored in the /etc/default/useradd file.\n
    You may need to modify two parameters in this file to suit your particular needs.\n
    \n
    '
    ________________________________________HIGHLIGHT________________________________________ 32 '
    /etc/default/useradd' 'Parameter Explanations' '
    \n
    GROUP=1000\n
    ----------\n
    This parameter sets the beginning of the group numbers used in the /etc/group file.\n
    You can modify it to anything you desire.\n
    Note that useradd will never reuse a UID or GID.\n
    If the number identified in this parameter is used, it will use the next available number after this.\n
    Note also that if you dont have a group 1000 on your system the first time you use useradd without the -g parameter,\n
    youll get a message displayed on the terminal that says: useradd: unknown GID 1000.\n
    You may disregard this message and group number 1000 will be used.\n
    \n
    CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL=yes\n
    ---------------------\n
    This parameter causes useradd to create a mailbox file for the newly created user.\n
    useradd will make the group ownership of this file to the mail group with 0660 permissions.\n
    If you would prefer that these mailbox files are not created by useradd, issue the following command:\n
    '
    sed -i 's/yes/no/' /etc/default/useradd

    ________________________________________IMPORTANT________________________________________ '
    In this section, the test suite for GCC is considered critical. Do not skip it under any circumstance.
    '
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    One set of tests in the GCC test suite is known to exhaust the stack, so increase the stack size prior to running the tests:
    '
    ulimit -s 32768
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    Remove one test known to cause a problem:
    '
    rm ../gcc/testsuite/g++.dg/pr83239.C
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    Test the results as a non-privileged user, but do not stop at errors:
    '
    chown -Rv nobody .
    su nobody -s /bin/bash -c "PATH=$PATH make -k check"
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    To receive a summary of the test suite results, run:
    '
    ../contrib/test_summary
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    For only the summaries, pipe the output through grep -A7 Summ.
    '
    ../contrib/test_summary | grep -A7 Summ
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    Results can be compared with those located at http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/build-logs/8.3/ and https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-testresults/.
    A few unexpected failures cannot always be avoided.
    The GCC developers are usually aware of these issues, but have not resolved them yet.
    Unless the test results are vastly different from those at the above URL, it is safe to continue.
    '
    ________________________________________NOTE________________________________________ '
    On some combinations of kernel configuration and AMD processors there may be more than 1100 failures
    in the gcc.target/i386/mpx tests (which are designed to test the MPX option on recent Intel processors).
    These can safely be ignored on AMD processors.
    These tests will also fail on Intel processors if MPX support is not enabled in the kernel even though it is present on the CPU.

    Create a symlink required by the FHS for "historical" reasons.
    '
    ln -sv ../usr/bin/cpp /lib
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    Many packages use the name cc to call the C compiler. To satisfy those packages, create a symlink:
    '
    ln -sv gcc /usr/bin/cc
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    Add a compatibility symlink to enable building programs with Link Time Optimization (LTO):
    '
    install -v -dm755 /usr/lib/bfd-plugins
    ln -sfv ../../libexec/gcc/$(gcc -dumpmachine)/8.2.0/liblto_plugin.so \
            /usr/lib/bfd-plugins/
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    Now that our final toolchain is in place, it is important to again ensure that compiling and linking will work as expected.
    We do this by performing the same sanity checks as we did earlier in the chapter:
    '
    echo 'int main(){}' > dummy.c
    cc dummy.c -v -Wl,--verbose &> dummy.log
    readelf -l a.out | grep ': /lib'
    ________________________________________there_should_have________________________________________ '
    There should be no errors, and the output of the last command will be (allowing for platform-specific differences in dynamic linker name):' '
    [Requesting program interpreter: /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2]
    '
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    Now make sure that we'"'"'re setup to use the correct start files:
    '
    grep -o '/usr/lib.*/crt[1in].*succeeded' dummy.log
    ________________________________________there_should_have________________________________________ '
    The output of the last command should be:' '
    /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/8.2.0/../../../../lib/crt1.o succeeded
    /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/8.2.0/../../../../lib/crti.o succeeded
    /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/8.2.0/../../../../lib/crtn.o succeeded' '
    Depending on your machine architecture, the above may differ slightly,
    the difference usually being the name of the directory after /usr/lib/gcc.' '
    The important thing to look for here is that gcc has found all three crt*.o files under the /usr/lib directory.
    '
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    Verify that the compiler is searching for the correct header files:
    '
    grep -B4 '^ /usr/include' dummy.log
    ________________________________________there_should_have________________________________________ '
    This command should return the following output:' '
    #include <...> search starts here:
     /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/8.2.0/include
     /usr/local/include
     /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/8.2.0/include-fixed
     /usr/include' '
    Again, note that the directory named after your target triplet may be different than the above, depending on your architecture.
    '
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    Next, verify that the new linker is being used with the correct search paths:
    '
    grep 'SEARCH.*/usr/lib' dummy.log |sed 's|; |\n|g'
    ________________________________________there_should_have________________________________________ '
    References to paths that have components with '-linux-gnu' should be ignored, but otherwise the output of the last command should be:' '
    SEARCH_DIR("/usr/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib64")
    SEARCH_DIR("/usr/local/lib64")
    SEARCH_DIR("/lib64")
    SEARCH_DIR("/usr/lib64")
    SEARCH_DIR("/usr/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib")
    SEARCH_DIR("/usr/local/lib")
    SEARCH_DIR("/lib")
    SEARCH_DIR("/usr/lib");' '
    A 32-bit system may see a few different directories. For example, here is the output from an i686 machine:' '
    SEARCH_DIR("/usr/i686-pc-linux-gnu/lib32")
    SEARCH_DIR("/usr/local/lib32")
    SEARCH_DIR("/lib32")
    SEARCH_DIR("/usr/lib32")
    SEARCH_DIR("/usr/i686-pc-linux-gnu/lib")
    SEARCH_DIR("/usr/local/lib")
    SEARCH_DIR("/lib")
    SEARCH_DIR("/usr/lib");
    '
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    Next make sure that we'"'"'re using the correct libc:
    '
    grep "/lib.*/libc.so.6 " dummy.log
    ________________________________________there_should_have________________________________________ '
    The output of the last command should be:' '
    attempt to open /lib/libc.so.6 succeeded
    '
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    Lastly, make sure GCC is using the correct dynamic linker:
    '
    grep found dummy.log
    ________________________________________there_should_have________________________________________ '
    The output of the last command should be (allowing for platform-specific differences in dynamic linker name): ' '
    found ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 at /lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 ' '
    If the output does not appear as shown above or is not received at all, then something is seriously wrong.
    Investigate and retrace the steps to find out where the problem is and correct it.
    The most likely reason is that something went wrong with the specs file adjustment.
    Any issues will need to be resolved before continuing with the process.
    '
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    Once everything is working correctly, clean up the test files:
    '
    rm -v dummy.c a.out dummy.log
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    Finally, move a misplaced file:
    '
    mkdir -pv /usr/share/gdb/auto-load/usr/lib
    mv -v /usr/lib/*gdb.py /usr/share/gdb/auto-load/usr/lib

    Move the shared libraries to the /lib directory, where they are expected to reside:
    '
    mv -v /usr/lib/libncursesw.so.6* /lib

    Because the libraries have been moved, one symlink points to a non-existent file. Recreate it:

    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    Many applications still expect the linker to be able to find non-wide-character Ncurses libraries.
    Trick such applications into linking with wide-character libraries by means of symlinks and linker scripts:
    '
    for lib in ncurses form panel menu ; do
        rm -vf                    /usr/lib/lib${lib}.so

        ln -sfv ${lib}w.pc        /usr/lib/pkgconfig/${lib}.pc
    done
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    Finally, make sure that old applications that look for -lcurses at build time are still buildable:
    '
    rm -vf                     /usr/lib/libcursesw.so
    echo "INPUT(-lncursesw)" > /usr/lib/libcursesw.so
    ln -sfv libncurses.so      /usr/lib/libcurses.so
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    If desired, install the Ncurses documentation:
    '
    mkdir -v       /usr/share/doc/ncurses-6.1
    cp -v -R doc/* /usr/share/doc/ncurses-6.1
    ________________________________________NOTE________________________________________ '
    The instructions above don'"'"'t create non-wide-character Ncurses libraries since no package installed
    by compiling from sources would link against them at runtime.
    However, the only known binary-only applications that link against non-wide-character Ncurses libraries require version 5.

    When run, ninja normally runs a maximum number of processes in parallel.
    By default this is the number of cores on the system plus two.
    In some cases this can overheat a CPU or run a system out of memory.
    If run from the command line, passing a -jN parameter will limit the number of parallel processes,
    but some packages embed the execution of ninja and do not pass a -j parameter.
    Using the optional patch below allows a user to limit the number of parallel processes via an environment variable, NINJAJOBS. For example setting:
    '
    export NINJAJOBS=64
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '

    We are going to run the remainder of the tests as the nobody user.
    Certain tests, however, require that the user be a member of more than one group.
    So that these tests are not skipped well add a temporary group and make the user nobody a part of it:
    '
    echo "dummy:x:1000:nobody" >> /etc/group
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    Fix some of the permissions so that the non-root user can compile and run the tests:
    '
    chown -Rv nobody .
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    Now run the tests. Make sure the PATH in the su environment includes /tools/bin.

    su nobody -s /bin/bash \
              -c "PATH=$PATH make RUN_EXPENSIVE_TESTS=yes check"

    Groff expects the environment variable PAGE to contain the default paper size.
    For users in the United States, PAGE=letter is appropriate. Elsewhere, PAGE=A4 may be more suitable.
    While the default paper size is configured during compilation,
    it can be overridden later by echoing either “A4” or “letter” to the /etc/papersize file.

    Many users are used to using vi instead of vim.
    To allow execution of vim when users habitually enter vi,
    create a symlink for both the binary and the man page in the provided languages:
    '
    ln -sv vim /usr/bin/vi
    for L in  /usr/share/man/{,*/}man1/vim.1; do
        ln -sv vim.1 $(dirname $L)/vi.1

    The following symlink allows the documentation to be accessed via /usr/share/doc/vim-8.1,

    '
    ln -sv ../vim/vim81/doc /usr/share/doc/vim-8.1

    If an X Window System is going to be installed on the LFS system, it may be necessary to recompile Vim after installing X.
    Vim comes with a GUI version of the editor that requires X and some additional libraries to be installed.
    For more information on this process, refer to the Vim documentation and the Vim installation page in the BLFS book at
    http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/8.3/postlfs/vim.html.
    '
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    By default, vim runs in vi-incompatible mode.
    This may be new to users who have used other editors in the past.
    The “nocompatible” setting is included below to highlight the fact that a new behavior is being used.
    It also reminds those who would change to “compatible” mode that it should be the first setting in the configuration file.
    This is necessary because it changes other settings, and overrides must come after this setting.
    Create a default vim configuration file by running the following:
    '
    cat > /etc/vimrc << "EOF"
" Begin /etc/vimrc

" Ensure defaults are set before customizing settings, not after
source $VIMRUNTIME/defaults.vim
let skip_defaults_vim=1

set nocompatible
set backspace=2
set mouse=
syntax on
if (&term == "xterm") || (&term == "putty")
  set background=dark
endif

" End /etc/vimrc
EOF

    Documentation for other available options can be obtained by running the following command:
    '
    vim -c ':options'
    ________________________________________NOTE________________________________________ '
    By default, Vim only installs spell files for the English language.
    To install spell files for your preferred language, download the *.spl and optionally,
    the *.sug files for your language and character encoding from
    ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/runtime/spell/ and save them to /usr/share/vim/vim81/spell/.\n
    \n
    To use these spell files, some configuration in /etc/vimrc is needed, e.g.:\n
    \n
    set spelllang=en,ru\n
    set spell\n
    \n
    For more information, see the appropriate README file located at the URL above.\n

    Removing /tools will also remove the temporary copies of Tcl, Expect, and DejaGNU which were used for running the toolchain tests.
    If you need these programs later on, they will need to be recompiled and re-installed.
    The BLFS book has instructions for this (see http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/).

    Udev normally assigns network card interface names based on system physical characteristics such as enp2s1.
    If you are not sure what your interface name is, you can always run ip link after you have booted your system.

    For most systems, there is only one network interface for each type of connection.
    For example, the classic interface name for a wired connection is eth0.
    A wireless connection will usually have the name \033[1;32mwifi0 \033[0;37mor \033[1;32mwlan0\033[0;37m.

    7.2.4. Customizing the /etc/hosts File
    ' '
    Decide on a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), and possible aliases for use in the /etc/hosts file.
    If using static addresses, youll also need to decide on an IP address. The syntax for a hosts file entry is:

    IP_address myhost.example.org aliases
    Unless the computer is to be visible to the Internet (i.e., there is a registered domain
    and a valid block of assigned IP addresses—most users do not have this), make sure that
    the IP address is in the private network IP address range. Valid ranges are:

    Private Network Address Range      Normal Prefix
    10.0.0.1 - 10.255.255.254           8
    172.x.0.1 - 172.x.255.254           16
    192.168.y.1 - 192.168.y.254         24

    x can be any number in the range 16-31. y can be any number in the range 0-255.

    A valid private IP address could be 192.168.1.1.
    A valid FQDN for this IP could be lfs.example.org.

    Even if not using a network card, a valid FQDN is still required.
    This is necessary for certain programs to operate correctly.

    If using DHCP, DHCPv6, IPv6 Autoconfiguration, or if a network card is not going to be configured,
    create the /etc/hosts file by running the following command:
    \033[1;33m
    cat > /etc/hosts << "EOF"
    # Begin /etc/hosts

    127.0.0.1 localhost
    127.0.1.1 <FQDN> <HOSTNAME>
    ::1       localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
    ff02::1   ip6-allnodes
    ff02::2   ip6-allrouters

    # End /etc/hosts
    EOF
    '

    cat > /etc/hosts << "EOF"
# Begin /etc/hosts

127.0.0.1 localhost
::1       localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1   ip6-allnodes
ff02::2   ip6-allrouters

# End /etc/hosts
EOF

    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    The ::1 entry is the IPv6 counterpart of 127.0.0.1 and represents the IPv6 loopback interface.
    127.0.1.1 is a loopback entry reserved specifically for the FQDN.

    If using a static address, create the /etc/hosts file by running this command instead:

    \033[1;33m
    cat > /etc/hosts << "EOF"
    # Begin /etc/hosts

    127.0.0.1 localhost
    127.0.1.1 <FQDN> <HOSTNAME>
    <192.168.0.2> <FQDN> <HOSTNAME> [alias1] [alias2] ...
    ::1       localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
    ff02::1   ip6-allnodes
    ff02::2   ip6-allrouters

    # End /etc/hosts
    EOF
    '
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    The <192.168.0.2>, <FQDN>, and <HOSTNAME> values need to be changed for specific uses or requirements
    (if assigned an IP address by a network/system administrator and the machine will be connected to an existing network).
    The optional alias name(s) can be omitted.

    7.5. Configuring the system clock

    This section discusses how to configure the systemd-timedated system service, which configures system clock and timezone.
    '

    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    If you cannot remember whether or not the hardware clock is set to UTC, find out by running the hwclock --localtime --show command.
    This will display what the current time is according to the hardware clock.
    If this time matches whatever your watch says, then the hardware clock is set to local time.
    If the output from hwclock is not local time, chances are it is set to UTC time.
    Verify this by adding or subtracting the proper amount of hours for the timezone to the time shown by hwclock.
    For example, if you are currently in the MST timezone, which is also known as GMT -0700, add seven hours to the local time.
    '
    _lfs_is_hardware_clock_set_to_utc
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    systemd-timedated reads /etc/adjtime, and depending on the contents of the file, it sets the clock to either UTC or local time.

    Create the /etc/adjtime file with the following contents if your hardware clock is set to local time:

    cat > /etc/adjtime << "EOF"
    0.0 0 0.0
    0
    LOCAL
    EOF
    If /etc/adjtime isnt present at first boot,
    systemd-timedated will assume that hardware clock is set to UTC and adjust the file according to that.

    You can also use the timedatectl utility to tell systemd-timedated if your hardware clock is set to UTC or local time:

    timedatectl set-local-rtc 1
    timedatectl can also be used to change system time and time zone.

    To change your current system time, issue:

    timedatectl set-time YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
    Hardware clock will also be updated accordingly.

    To change your current time zone, issue:

    timedatectl set-timezone TIMEZONE
    You can get a list of available time zones by running:

    timedatectl list-timezones
    Note
    Please note that the timedatectl command can be used only on a system booted with systemd.

    7.5.1. Network Time Synchronization
    Starting with version 213, systemd ships a daemon called systemd-timesyncd
    which can be used to synchronize the system time with remote NTP servers.

    The daemon is not intended as a replacement for the well established NTP daemon,
    but as a client only implementation of the SNTP protocol
    which can be used for less advanced tasks and on resource limited systems.

    Starting with systemd version 216, the systemd-timesyncd daemon is enabled by default.
    If you want to disable it, issue the following command:

    systemctl disable systemd-timesyncd
    The /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf file can be used to change the NTP servers that systemd-timesyncd synchronizes with.

    Please note that when system clock is set to Local Time, systemd-timesyncd wont update hardware clock.

_lfs_configure_linux_console() {

    7.6. Configuring the Linux Console
    This section discusses how to configure the systemd-vconsole-setup system service,
    which configures the virtual console font and console keymap.

    The systemd-vconsole-setup service reads the /etc/vconsole.conf file for configuration information.
    Decide which keymap and screen font will be used.
    Various language-specific HOWTOs can also help with this, see http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/HOWTO-INDEX/other-lang.html.
    Examine localectl list-keymaps output for a list of valid console keymaps.
    Look in /usr/share/consolefonts directory for valid screen fonts.

    The /etc/vconsole.conf file should contain lines of the form: VARIABLE="value". The following variables are recognized:

    KEYMAP
    This variable specifies the key mapping table for the keyboard. If unset, it defaults to us.

    KEYMAP_TOGGLE
    This variable can be used to configure a second toggle keymap and is unset by default.

    FONT
    This variable specifies the font used by the virtual console.

    FONT_MAP
    This variable specifies the console map to be used.

    FONT_UNIMAP
    This variable specifies the Unicode font map.

    An example for a German keyboard and console is given below:

    cat > /etc/vconsole.conf << "EOF"
    KEYMAP=de-latin1
    FONT=Lat2-Terminus16
    EOF
    You can change KEYMAP value at runtime by using the localectl utility:

    localectl set-keymap MAP
    Note
    Please note that the localectl command can be used only on a system booted with systemd.

    You can also use localectl utility with the corresponding parameters to change X11 keyboard layout, model, variant and options:

    localectl set-x11-keymap LAYOUT [MODEL] [VARIANT] [OPTIONS]
    To list possible values for localectl set-x11-keymap parameters, run localectl with parameters listed below:

    list-x11-keymap-models
    Show known X11 keyboard mapping models.

    list-x11-keymap-layouts
    Show known X11 keyboard mapping layouts.

    list-x11-keymap-variants
    Show known X11 keyboard mapping variants.

    list-x11-keymap-options
    Show known X11 keyboard mapping options.

    Note
    Using any of the parameters listed above requires the XKeyboard Config package from BLFS.

    7.8. Creating the /etc/inputrc File

    The inputrc file is the configuration file for the Readline library,
    which provides editing capabilities while the user is entering a line from the terminal.
    It works by tranlating keyboard inputs into specific actions.
    Readline is used by Bash and most other shells as well as many other applications.

    Most people do not need user-specific functionality so the command below
    creates a global /etc/inputrc used by everyone who logs in.
    If you later decide you need to override the defaults on a per-user basis,
    you can create a .inputrc file in the user s home directory with the modified mappings.

    For more information on how to edit the inputrc file,
    see info bash under the Readline Init File section.
    info readline is also a good source of information.

    Below is a generic global inputrc along with comments to explain what the various options do.
    Note that comments cannot be on the same line as commands.
    Create the file using the following command:
    '
    cat > /etc/inputrc << "EOF"
# Begin /etc/inputrc
# Modified by Chris Lynn <roryo@roryo.dynup.net>

# Allow the command prompt to wrap to the next line

_lfs_create_etc_shells() {
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    7.9. Creating the /etc/shells File

    The shells file contains a list of login shells on the system.
    Applications use this file to determine whether a shell is valid.
    For each shell a single line should be present, consisting of the shell s path,
    relative to the root of the directory structure (/).

    For example, this file is consulted by chsh to determine whether an
    unprivileged user may change the login shell for her own account.
    If the command name is not listed, the user will be denied of change.

    It is a requirement for applications such as GDM which does not populate the face browser
    if it cant find /etc/shells, or FTP daemons which traditionally disallow access to users
    with shells not included in this file.

    7.10. Systemd Usage and Configuration

    7.10.1. Basic Configuration

    The /etc/systemd/system.conf file contains a set of options to control basic systemd operations.
    The default file has all entries commented out with the default settings indicated.
    This file is where the log level may be changed as well as some basic logging settings.

    \033[0;32mSee the \033[0;1;32msystemd-system.conf(5)\033[0;32m manual page for details on each configuration option.
    '
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    7.10.2. Disabling Screen Clearing at Boot Time

    The normal behavior for systemd is to clear the screen at the end of the boot sequence.
    If desired, this behavior may be changed by running the following command:
    '
    mkdir -pv /etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service.d
    cat > /etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service.d/noclear.conf << EOF
[Service]
TTYVTDisallocate=no
EOF
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    The boot messages can always be reviewed by using the journalctl -b command as the root user.

    7.10.3. Disabling tmpfs for /tmp
    By default, /tmp is created as a tmpfs. If this is not desired, it can be overridden by the following:
    \033[1;33m
    ln -sfv /dev/null /etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount
    '
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    Alternatively, if a a separate partition for /tmp is desired, specify that partition in an /etc/fstab entry.
    '
    ________________________________________NOTE________________________________________ '
    Warning' '
    Do not create the symbolic link above if a separate partition is used for /tmp.
    This will prvent the root file system (/) from being remounted r/w and make the system unusable when booted.
    '
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    7.10.4. Configuring Automatic File Creation and Deletion

    There are several services that create or delete files or directories:

    * systemd-tmpfiles-clean.service
    * systemd-tmpfiles-setup-dev.service
    * systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service

    The system location for the configuration files is /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/*.conf.
    The local configuration files are in /etc/tmpfiles.d.
    Files in /etc/tmpfiles.d override files with the same name in /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d.
    See tmpfiles.d(5) manual page for file format details.

    Note that the syntax for the /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/*.conf files can be confusing.
    For example, the default deletion of files in the /tmp directory is located in /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tmp.conf with the line:
    \033[1;33m
    q /tmp 1777 root root 10d
    '
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    The type field, q, discusses creating a subvolume with quotas which is really only applicable to btrfs filesystems.
    It references type v which in turn references type d (directory).
    This then creates the specified directory if is is not present and adjusts the permissions and ownership as specified.
    Contents of the directory will be subject to time based cleanup if the age argument is specified.

    If the default parameters are not desired, then the file should be copied to /etc/tmpfiles.d and edited as desired.
    For example:
    \033[1;33m
    mkdir -p /etc/tempfiles.d
    cp /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tmp.conf /etc/tempfiles.d
    '
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    7.10.5. Overriding Default Services Behavior

    The parameter of a unit can be overriden by creating a directory and a configuration file in /etc/systemd/system.
    For example:
    \033[1;33m
    mkdir -pv /etc/systemd/system/foobar.service.d

    cat > /etc/systemd/system/foobar.service.d/foobar.conf << EOF
    [Service]
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=30
    EOF
    '
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    See systemd.unit(5) manual page for more information.
    After creating the configuration file, run
        systemctl daemon-reload
    and
        systemctl restart foobar
    to activate the changes to a service.

    7.10.6. Debugging the Boot Sequence

    Rather than plain shell scripts used in SysVinit or BSD style init systems,
    systemd uses a unified format for different types of startup files (or units).
    The command systemctl is used to enable, disable, control state, and obtain status of unit files.
    Here are some examples of frequently used commands:

    * systemctl list-units -t <service> [--all]: lists loaded unit files of type service.
    * systemctl list-units -t <target> [--all]: lists loaded unit files of type target.
    * systemctl show -p Wants <multi-user.target>: shows all units that depend on the multi-user target.
      Targets are special unit files that are anogalous to runlevels under SysVinit.
    * systemctl status <servicename.service>: shows the status of the servicename service.
      The .service extension can be omitted if there are no other unit files with the same name,
      such as .socket files (which create a listening socket that provides similar functionality to inetd/xinetd).

    7.10.7. Working with the Systemd Journal

    Logging on a system booted with systemd is handled with systemd-journald (by default),
    rather than a typical unix syslog daemon.
    You can also add a normal syslog daemon and have both work side by side if desired.
    The systemd-journald program stores journal entries in a binary format rather than a plain text log file.
    To assist with parsing the file, the command journalctl is provided. Here are some examples of frequently used commands:

    * journalctl -r: shows all contents of the journal in reverse chronological order.
    * journalctl -u UNIT: shows the journal entries associated with the specified UNIT file.
    * journalctl -b[=ID] -r: shows the journal entries since last successful boot (or for boot ID) in reverse chronological order.
    * journalctl -f: povides functionality similar to tail -f (follow).

    7.10.8. Long Running Processes

    Beginning with systemd-230, all user processes are killed when a user session is ended,
    even if nohup is used, or the process uses the daemon() or setsid() functions.
    This is a deliberate change from a historically permissive environment to a more restrictive one.
    The new behavior may cause issues if you depend on long running programs (e.g., screen or tmux)
    to remain active after ending your user session.
    There are three ways to enable lingering processes to remain after a user session is ended.

    * Enable process lingering for only selected users:
      Normal users have permission to enable process lingering with the command loginctl enable-linger for their own user.
      System administrators can use the same command with a user argument to enable for a user.
      That user can then use the systemd-run command to start long running processes.
      For example: systemd-run --scope --user /usr/bin/screen.
      If you enable lingering for your user, the user@.service will remain even after all login sessions are closed,
      and will automatically start at system boot. This has the advantage of explicitly allowing
      and disallowing processes to run after the user session has ended,
      but breaks backwards compatibility with tools like nohup and utilities that use deamon().

    * Enable system-wide process lingering:
      You can set KillUserProcesses=no in /etc/logind.conf to enable process lingering globally for all users.
      This has the benefit of leaving the old method available to all users at the expense of explicit control.

    * Disable at build-time:
      You can enable lingering by default while building systemd by adding
      the switch --without-kill-user-processes to the configure command for systemd.
      This completely disables the ability of systemd to kill user processes at session end.

    8.1. Introduction

    It is time to make the LFS system bootable.
    This chapter discusses
    - creating an fstab file,
    - building a kernel for the new LFS system, and
    - installing the GRUB boot loader so that the LFS system can be selected for booting at startup.

    The /etc/fstab file is used by some programs to determine where file systems are to be mounted by default,
    in which order, and which must be checked (for integrity errors) prior to mounting.

    8.3. Linux-4.18.5 (4.4-66 (typically~6) SBU; 960-4250 (typically~1100) MB)

    8.3.1. Installation of the kernel

    Building the kernel involves a few steps—configuration, compilation, and installation.
    Read the README file in the kernel source tree for alternative methods to the way this book configures the kernel.

    Prepare for compilation by running the following command:

    make mrproper

    This ensures that the kernel tree is absolutely clean.
    The kernel team recommends that this command be issued prior to each kernel compilation.
    Do not rely on the source tree being clean after un-tarring.

    Configure the kernel via a menu-driven interface.
    For general information on kernel configuration see
    http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/kernel-configuration.txt.
    BLFS has some information regarding particular kernel configuration requirements of packages outside of LFS
    at http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/8.3/longindex.html#kernel-config-index.
    Additional information about configuring and building the kernel can be found at http://www.kroah.com/lkn/
    '
    make mrproper
    ________________________________________NOTE________________________________________ '
    A good starting place for setting up the kernel configuration is to run make defconfig.
    This will set the base configuration to a good state that takes your current system architecture into account.

    Be sure to enable/disable/set the following features or the system might not work correctly or boot at all:

    If your host hardware is using UEFI, then the make defconfig above should automatically add in some EFI-related kernel options.

    In order to allow your LFS kernel to be booted from within your host s UEFI boot environment,
    your kernel must have this option selected
    (A fuller description of managing UEFI environments from within LFS is covered by the lfs-uefi.txt hint

    After kernel compilation is complete, additional steps are required to complete the installation.
    Some files need to be copied to the /boot directory.
    '
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    The path to the kernel image may vary depending on the platform being used.
    The filename below can be changed to suit your taste, but the stem of the filename
    should be vmlinuz to be compatible with the automatic setup of the boot process described in the next section.
    The following command assumes an x86 architecture:
    cp -iv arch/x86/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-4.18.5-lfs-8.3-systemd
    '
    cp -iv arch/x86/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-4.18.5-lfs-8.3-systemd
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    System.map is a symbol file for the kernel.
    It maps the function entry points of every function in the kernel API,
    as well as the addresses of the kernel data structures for the running kernel.
    It is used as a resource when investigating kernel problems. Issue the following command to install the map file:
    cp -iv System.map /boot/System.map-4.18.5
    '
    cp -iv System.map /boot/System.map-4.18.5
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    The kernel configuration file .config produced by the make menuconfig step above contains
    all the configuration selections for the kernel that was just compiled.
    It is a good idea to keep this file for future reference:

    cp -iv .config /boot/config-4.18.5
    '
    cp -iv .config /boot/config-4.18.5
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    Install the documentation for the Linux kernel:
    install -d /usr/share/doc/linux-4.18.5
    cp -r Documentation/* /usr/share/doc/linux-4.18.5
    '
    install -d /usr/share/doc/linux-4.18.5
    cp -r Documentation/* /usr/share/doc/linux-4.18.5
    ________________________________________NOTE________________________________________ '
    It is important to note that the files in the kernel source directory are not owned by root.
    Whenever a package is unpacked as user root (like we did inside chroot),
    the files have the user and group IDs of whatever they were on the packager s computer.
    This is usually not a problem for any other package to be installed because the source tree is removed after the installation.
    However, the Linux source tree is often retained for a long time.
    Because of this, there is a chance that whatever user ID the packager used will be assigned to somebody on the machine.
    That person would then have write access to the kernel source.

    In many cases, the configuration of the kernel will need to be updated for packages that will be installed later in BLFS.
    Unlike other packages, it is not necessary to remove the kernel source tree after the newly built kernel is installed.

    If the kernel source tree is going to be retained, run
        chown -R 0:0
    on the linux-4.18.5 directory to ensure all files are owned by user root.
    '
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    \033[0;35mSome kernel documentation recommends creating a symlink from /usr/src/linux pointing to the kernel source directory.
    This is specific to kernels prior to the 2.6 series and \033[1;31mmust not\033[0;35m be created on an LFS system
    as it can cause problems for packages you may wish to build once your base LFS system is complete.
    '
    ________________________________________NOTE________________________________________ '
    The headers in the system s include directory (/usr/include) should always be the ones against which Glibc was compiled,
    that is, the sanitised headers installed in Section 6.7, “Linux-4.18.5 API Headers”.
    Therefore, they should never be replaced by either the raw kernel headers or any other kernel sanitized headers.

    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    8.3.2. Configuring Linux Module Load Order

    Most of the time Linux modules are loaded automatically, but sometimes it needs some specific direction.
    The program that loads modules, modprobe or insmod, uses /etc/modprobe.d/usb.conf for this purpose.
    This file needs to be created so that if the USB drivers (ehci_hcd, ohci_hcd and uhci_hcd) have been built as modules,
    they will be loaded in the correct order;
    ehci_hcd needs to be loaded prior to ohci_hcd and uhci_hcd in order to avoid a warning being output at boot time.

    Create a new file /etc/modprobe.d/usb.conf:
    '
    install -v -m755 -d /etc/modprobe.d
    cat > /etc/modprobe.d/usb.conf << "EOF"
# Begin /etc/modprobe.d/usb.conf

install ohci_hcd /sbin/modprobe ehci_hcd ; /sbin/modprobe -i ohci_hcd ; true
install uhci_hcd /sbin/modprobe ehci_hcd ; /sbin/modprobe -i uhci_hcd ; true

# End /etc/modprobe.d/usb.conf
EOF

    Ensure that an emergency boot disk is ready to “rescue” the computer if the computer becomes unusable (un-bootable).
    If you do not already have a boot device, you can create one.
    In order for the procedure below to work, you need to jump ahead to BLFS and install xorriso from the libisoburn package.
    '
    cd /tmp
    grub-mkrescue --output=grub-img.iso
    xorriso -as cdrecord -v dev=/dev/cdrw blank=as_needed grub-img.iso
    ________________________________________NOTE________________________________________ '
    To boot LFS on host systems that have UEFI enabled, the kernel needs to have been built with the
    CONFIG_EFI_STUB capabality described in the previous section.
    However, LFS can be booted using GRUB2 without such an addition.
    To do this, the UEFI Mode and Secure Boot capabilities in the host system s BIOS need to be turned off.
    For details, see the lfs-uefi.txt hint at http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/lfs-uefi.txt.

}

_lfs_grub() {
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    8.4.2. GRUB Naming Conventions
    \033[0;32m
    GRUB uses its own naming structure for drives and partitions in the form of
        \033[1;32m(hdn,m)\033[0;32m,
    where \033[1;32mn\033[0;32m is the hard drive number and \033[1;32mm\033[0;32m is the partition number.

    The hard drive number starts from \033[1;32mzero\033[0;32m,
    but the partition number starts from \033[1;32mone for normal partitions\033[0;32m and \033[1;32mfive for extended partitions\033[0;32m.
    Note that this is different from earlier versions where both numbers started from zero.
    For example, \033[1;32mpartition sda1 is (hd0,1) to GRUB\033[0;32m and \033[1;32msdb3 is (hd1,3)\033[0;32m.

    In contrast to Linux, GRUB does not consider CD-ROM drives to be hard drives.
    For example, if using a CD on hdb and a second hard drive on hdc, that second hard drive would still be (hd1).
    '
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    8.4.3. Setting Up the Configuration

    GRUB works by writing data to the first physical track of the hard disk.
    This area is not part of any file system.
    The programs there access GRUB modules in the boot partition.
    The default location is /boot/grub/.

    The location of the boot partition is a choice of the user that affects the configuration.
    One recommendation is to have a separate small (suggested size is 100 MB) partition just for boot information.
    That way each build, whether LFS or some commercial distro, can access the same boot files and access can be made from any booted system.
    If you choose to do this, you will need to mount the separate partition,
    move all files in the current /boot directory (e.g. the linux kernel you just built in the previous section) to the new partition.
    You will then need to unmount the partition and remount it as /boot. If you do this, be sure to update /etc/fstab.

    Using the current lfs partition will also work, but configuration for multiple systems is more difficult.

    Using the above information, determine the appropriate designator for the root partition (or boot partition, if a separate one is used).
    For the following example, it is assumed that the root (or separate boot) partition is \033[1;31msdc1\033[0;37m.
    '
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    Install the GRUB files into /boot/grub and set up the boot track:
    grub-install /dev/sdc
    '
    ________________________________________IMPORTANT________________________________________ '
    Warning' '
    This command will overwrite the current boot loader.
    Do not run the command if this is not desired,
    for example, if using a third party boot manager to manage the Master Boot Record (MBR).
    '
    grub-install /dev/sdc
    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    8.4.4. Creating the GRUB Configuration File

    Generate /boot/grub/grub.cfg:
    '
    cat > /boot/grub/grub.cfg << "EOF"
# Begin /boot/grub/grub.cfg
set default=0
set timeout=5

insmod ext2
set root=(hd0,1)

menuentry "GNU/Linux, Linux 4.18.5-lfs-8.3-systemd" {
        linux   /boot/vmlinuz-4.18.5-lfs-8.3-systemd root=/dev/sda1 ro
}
EOF
    ________________________________________NOTE________________________________________ '
    I got an "VFS unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0 0)" error and it turned out
    that was because I was using a SCSI storage device controller in my virtualbox config.

    The problem went away after I changed it to SATA.

    Analysis:

    I got my clue from https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Knowledge_Base:Unable_to_mount_root_fs :
    The panic informs that the Linux kernel is unable to:
    * Detect the controller for the hard disk (a likely candidate if the message says unknown-block(0,0));
    * Detect the partition because it does not have support for the partition type (less likely, but still possible);
    * Mount the partition because it does not know how to access the file system
      (a likely candidate if the message gives a non-zero figure in the first number set, such as unknown-block(2,0));
    * Detect the partition because the wrong device was passed in the boot loader configuration.

    see also:
    * https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-from-scratch-13/chapter-8-kernel-config-853146/
    '

    ________________________________________NOTE________________________________________ '
    From GRUB s perspective, the kernel files are relative to the partition used.
    If you used a separate /boot partition, remove /boot from the above linux line.
    You will also need to change the set root line to point to the boot partition.
    '

    ________________________________________________________________________________ '
    GRUB is an extremely powerful program and it provides a tremendous number of options for
    booting from a wide variety of devices, operating systems, and partition types.
    There are also many options for customization such as graphical splash screens, playing sounds, mouse input, etc.
    The details of these options are beyond the scope of this introduction.
    '

    ________________________________________IMPORTANT________________________________________ '
    Caution' '
    There is a command, grub-mkconfig, that can write a configuration file automatically.
    It uses a set of scripts in /etc/grub.d/ and will destroy any customizations that you make.
    These scripts are designed primarily for non-source distributions and are not recommended for LFS.
    If you install a commercial Linux distribution, there is a good chance that this program will be run.
    Be sure to back up your grub.cfg file.

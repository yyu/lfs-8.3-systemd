  .SH "NAME"
systemd-fstab-generator \- Unit generator for /etc/fstab


  .SH "SYNOPSIS"

    .PP
/usr/lib/systemd/system\-generators/systemd\-fstab\-generator

  

  .SH "DESCRIPTION"

    

    .PP
systemd\-fstab\-generator
is a generator that translates
/etc/fstab
(see
\fBfstab\fR(5)
for details) into native systemd units early at boot and when configuration of the system manager is reloaded\&. This will instantiate mount and swap units as necessary\&.


    .PP
The
\fIpassno\fR
field is treated like a simple boolean, and the ordering information is discarded\&. However, if the root file system is checked, it is checked before all the other file systems\&.


    .PP
See
\fBsystemd.mount\fR(5)
and
\fBsystemd.swap\fR(5)
for more information about special
/etc/fstab
mount options this generator understands\&.


    .PP
One special topic is handling of symbolic links\&. Historical init implementations supported symlinks in
/etc/fstab\&. Because mount units will refuse mounts where the target is a symbolic link, this generator will resolve any symlinks as far as possible when processing
/etc/fstab
in order to enhance backwards compatibility\&. If a symlink target does not exist at the time that this generator runs, it is assumed that the symlink target is the final target of the mount\&.


    .PP
systemd\-fstab\-generator
implements
\fBsystemd.generator\fR(7)\&.

  

  .SH "KERNEL COMMAND LINE"

    

    .PP
systemd\-fstab\-generator
understands the following kernel command line parameters:


    


      .PP
\fIfstab=\fR, \fIrd\&.fstab=\fR
.RS 4

        
        

        Takes a boolean argument\&. Defaults to
yes\&. If
no, causes the generator to ignore any mounts or swap devices configured in
/etc/fstab\&.
\fIrd\&.fstab=\fR
is honored only by the initial RAM disk (initrd) while
\fIfstab=\fR
is honored by both the main system and the initrd\&.

      .RE

      .PP
\fIroot=\fR
.RS 4

        

        Takes the root filesystem to mount in the initrd\&.
\fIroot=\fR
is honored by the initrd\&.

      .RE

      .PP
\fIrootfstype=\fR
.RS 4

        

        Takes the root filesystem type that will be passed to the mount command\&.
\fIrootfstype=\fR
is honored by the initrd\&.

      .RE

      .PP
\fIrootflags=\fR
.RS 4

        

        Takes the root filesystem mount options to use\&.
\fIrootflags=\fR
is honored by the initrd\&.

      .RE

      .PP
\fImount\&.usr=\fR
.RS 4

        

        Takes the
/usr
filesystem to be mounted by the initrd\&. If
\fImount\&.usrfstype=\fR
or
\fImount\&.usrflags=\fR
is set, then
\fImount\&.usr=\fR
will default to the value set in
\fIroot=\fR\&.
.sp


        Otherwise, this parameter defaults to the
/usr
entry found in
/etc/fstab
on the root filesystem\&.
.sp


        \fImount\&.usr=\fR
is honored by the initrd\&.

      .RE

      .PP
\fImount\&.usrfstype=\fR
.RS 4

        

        Takes the
/usr
filesystem type that will be passed to the mount command\&. If
\fImount\&.usr=\fR
or
\fImount\&.usrflags=\fR
is set, then
\fImount\&.usrfstype=\fR
will default to the value set in
\fIrootfstype=\fR\&.
.sp


        Otherwise, this value will be read from the
/usr
entry in
/etc/fstab
on the root filesystem\&.
.sp


        \fImount\&.usrfstype=\fR
is honored by the initrd\&.

      .RE

      .PP
\fImount\&.usrflags=\fR
.RS 4

        

        Takes the
/usr
filesystem mount options to use\&. If
\fImount\&.usr=\fR
or
\fImount\&.usrfstype=\fR
is set, then
\fImount\&.usrflags=\fR
will default to the value set in
\fIrootflags=\fR\&.
.sp


        Otherwise, this value will be read from the
/usr
entry in
/etc/fstab
on the root filesystem\&.
.sp


        \fImount\&.usrflags=\fR
is honored by the initrd\&.

      .RE

      .PP
\fIsystemd\&.volatile=\fR
.RS 4

        

        Controls whether the system shall boot up in volatile mode\&. Takes a boolean argument or the special value
\fBstate\fR\&.
.sp


        If false (the default), this generator makes no changes to the mount tree and the system is booted up in normal mode\&.
.sp


        If true the generator ensures
\fBsystemd-volatile-root.service\fR(8)
is run as part of the initial RAM disk ("initrd")\&. This service changes the mount table before transitioning to the host system, so that a volatile memory file system (tmpfs) is used as root directory, with only
/usr
mounted into it from the configured root file system, in read\-only mode\&. This way the system operates in fully stateless mode, with all configuration and state reset at boot and lost at shutdown, as
/etc
and
/var
will be served from the (initially unpopulated) volatile memory file system\&.
.sp


        If set to
\fBstate\fR
the generator will leave the root directory mount point unaltered, however will mount a
tmpfs
file system to
/var\&. In this mode the normal system configuration (i\&.e\&. the contents of
/etc) is in effect (and may be modified during system runtime), however the system state (i\&.e\&. the contents of
/var) is reset at boot and lost at shutdown\&.
.sp


        Note that in none of these modes the root directory,
/etc,
/var
or any other resources stored in the root file system are physically removed\&. It\*(Aqs thus safe to boot a system that is normally operated in non\-volatile mode temporarily into volatile mode, without losing data\&.
.sp


        Note that enabling this setting will only work correctly on operating systems that can boot up with only
/usr
mounted, and are able to automatically populate
/etc, and also
/var
in case of
systemd\&.volatile=yes\&.

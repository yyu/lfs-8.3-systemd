  .SH "DESCRIPTION"

    

    .PP
A few units are treated specially by systemd\&. Many of them have special internal semantics and cannot be renamed, while others simply have a standard meaning and should be present on all systems\&.

  

  .SH "SPECIAL SYSTEM UNITS"

    

    

      .PP
\-\&.mount
.RS 4

        
        
          The root mount point, i\&.e\&. the mount unit for the
/
path\&. This unit is unconditionally active, during the entire time the system is up, as this mount point is where the basic userspace is running from\&.

        
      .RE

      .PP
basic\&.target
.RS 4

        
        
          A special target unit covering basic boot\-up\&.
.sp


          systemd automatically adds dependency of the type
\fIAfter=\fR
for this target unit to all services (except for those with
\fIDefaultDependencies=no\fR)\&.
.sp


          Usually, this should pull\-in all local mount points plus
/var,
/tmp
and
/var/tmp, swap devices, sockets, timers, path units and other basic initialization necessary for general purpose daemons\&. The mentioned mount points are special cased to allow them to be remote\&.
.sp


          This target usually does not pull in any non\-target units directly, but rather does so indirectly via other early boot targets\&. It is instead meant as a synchronization point for late boot services\&. Refer to
\fBbootup\fR(7)
for details on the targets involved\&.


        
      .RE
      .PP
ctrl\-alt\-del\&.target
.RS 4

        
        
          systemd starts this target whenever Control+Alt+Del is pressed on the console\&. Usually, this should be aliased (symlinked) to
reboot\&.target\&.

        
      .RE
      .PP
cryptsetup\&.target
.RS 4

        
        
          A target that pulls in setup services for all encrypted block devices\&.

        
      .RE
      .PP
dbus\&.service
.RS 4

        
        
          A special unit for the D\-Bus bus daemon\&. As soon as this service is fully started up systemd will connect to it and register its service\&.

        
      .RE
      .PP
dbus\&.socket
.RS 4

        
        
          A special unit for the D\-Bus system bus socket\&. All units with
\fIType=dbus\fR
automatically gain a dependency on this unit\&.

        
      .RE
      .PP
default\&.target
.RS 4

        
        
          The default unit systemd starts at bootup\&. Usually, this should be aliased (symlinked) to
multi\-user\&.target
or
graphical\&.target\&.
.sp


          The default unit systemd starts at bootup can be overridden with the
\fIsystemd\&.unit=\fR
kernel command line option\&.

        
      .RE
      .PP
display\-manager\&.service
.RS 4

        
        
          The display manager service\&. Usually, this should be aliased (symlinked) to
gdm\&.service
or a similar display manager service\&.

        
      .RE
      .PP
emergency\&.target
.RS 4

        
        
          A special target unit that starts an emergency shell on the main console\&. This target does not pull in any services or mounts\&. It is the most minimal version of starting the system in order to acquire an interactive shell; the only processes running are usually just the system manager (PID 1) and the shell process\&. This unit is supposed to be used with the kernel command line option
\fIsystemd\&.unit=\fR; it is also used when a file system check on a required file system fails, and boot\-up cannot continue\&. Compare with
rescue\&.target, which serves a similar purpose, but also starts the most basic services and mounts all file systems\&.
.sp


          Use the
systemd\&.unit=emergency\&.target
kernel command line option to boot into this mode\&. A short alias for this kernel command line option is
emergency, for compatibility with SysV\&.
.sp


          In many ways booting into
emergency\&.target
is similar to the effect of booting with
init=/bin/sh
on the kernel command line, except that emergency mode provides you with the full system and service manager, and allows starting individual units in order to continue the boot process in steps\&.

        
      .RE
      .PP
exit\&.target
.RS 4

        
        
          A special service unit for shutting down the system or user service manager\&. It is equivalent to
poweroff\&.target
on non\-container systems, and also works in containers\&.
.sp


          systemd will start this unit when it receives the
\fBSIGTERM\fR
or
\fBSIGINT\fR
signal when running as user service daemon\&.
.sp


          Normally, this (indirectly) pulls in
shutdown\&.target, which in turn should be conflicted by all units that want to be scheduled for shutdown when the service manager starts to exit\&.

        
      .RE
      .PP
final\&.target
.RS 4

        
        
          A special target unit that is used during the shutdown logic and may be used to pull in late services after all normal services are already terminated and all mounts unmounted\&.

        
      .RE
      .PP
getty\&.target
.RS 4

        
        
          A special target unit that pulls in statically configured local TTY
getty
instances\&.

        
      .RE
      .PP
graphical\&.target
.RS 4

        
        
          A special target unit for setting up a graphical login screen\&. This pulls in
multi\-user\&.target\&.
.sp


          Units that are needed for graphical logins shall add
\fIWants=\fR
dependencies for their unit to this unit (or
multi\-user\&.target) during installation\&. This is best configured via
\fIWantedBy=graphical\&.target\fR
in the unit\*(Aqs
[Install]
section\&.

        
      .RE
      .PP
hibernate\&.target
.RS 4

        
        
          A special target unit for hibernating the system\&. This pulls in
sleep\&.target\&.

        
      .RE
      .PP
hybrid\-sleep\&.target
.RS 4

        
        
          A special target unit for hibernating and suspending the system at the same time\&. This pulls in
sleep\&.target\&.

        
      .RE
      .PP
suspend\-then\-hibernate\&.target
.RS 4

        
        
          A special target unit for suspending the system for a period of time, waking it and putting it into hibernate\&. This pulls in
sleep\&.target\&.

        
      .RE

      .PP
halt\&.target
.RS 4

        
        
          A special target unit for shutting down and halting the system\&. Note that this target is distinct from
poweroff\&.target
in that it generally really just halts the system rather than powering it down\&.
.sp


          Applications wanting to halt the system should not start this unit directly, but should instead execute
\fBsystemctl halt\fR
(possibly with the
\fB\-\-no\-block\fR
option) or call
\fBsystemd\fR(1)\*(Aqs
\fBorg\&.freedesktop\&.systemd1\&.Manager\&.Halt\fR
D\-Bus method directly\&.

        
      .RE
      .PP
init\&.scope
.RS 4

        
        
          This scope unit is where the system and service manager (PID 1) itself resides\&. It is active as long as the system is running\&.

        
      .RE
      .PP
initrd\-fs\&.target
.RS 4

        
        
          \fBsystemd-fstab-generator\fR(3)
automatically adds dependencies of type
\fIBefore=\fR

sysroot\-usr\&.mount

      .RE
      .PP
initrd\-root\-device\&.target
.RS 4

        
        
          A special initrd target unit that is reached when the root filesystem device is available, but before it has been mounted\&.
\fBsystemd-fstab-generator\fR(3)
and
\fBsystemd-gpt-auto-generator\fR(3)
automatically setup the appropriate dependencies to make this happen\&.

        
      .RE
      .PP
initrd\-root\-fs\&.target
.RS 4

        
        
          \fBsystemd-fstab-generator\fR(3)
automatically adds dependencies of type
\fIBefore=\fR
to the
sysroot\&.mount
unit, which is generated from the kernel command line\&.

        
      .RE
      .PP
kbrequest\&.target
.RS 4

        
        
          systemd starts this target whenever Alt+ArrowUp is pressed on the console\&. Note that any user with physical access to the machine will be able to do this, without authentication, so this should be used carefully\&.

        
      .RE
      .PP
kexec\&.target
.RS 4

        
        
          A special target unit for shutting down and rebooting the system via kexec\&.
.sp


          Applications wanting to reboot the system should not start this unit directly, but should instead execute
\fBsystemctl kexec\fR
(possibly with the
\fB\-\-no\-block\fR
option) or call
\fBsystemd\fR(1)\*(Aqs
\fBorg\&.freedesktop\&.systemd1\&.Manager\&.KExec\fR
D\-Bus method directly\&.

        
      .RE

local\-fs\&.target
.RS 4

        
        
          \fBsystemd-fstab-generator\fR(3)
automatically adds dependencies of type
\fIBefore=\fR
to all mount units that refer to local mount points for this target unit\&. In addition, it adds dependencies of type
\fIWants=\fR
to this target unit for those mounts listed in
/etc/fstab
that have the
\fBauto\fR
mount option set\&.

        
      .RE
      .PP
machines\&.target
.RS 4

        
        
          A standard target unit for starting all the containers and other virtual machines\&. See
systemd\-nspawn@\&.service
for an example\&.

        
      .RE
      .PP
multi\-user\&.target
.RS 4

        
        
          A special target unit for setting up a multi\-user system (non\-graphical)\&. This is pulled in by
graphical\&.target\&.
.sp


          Units that are needed for a multi\-user system shall add
\fIWants=\fR
dependencies for their unit to this unit during installation\&. This is best configured via
\fIWantedBy=multi\-user\&.target\fR
in the unit\*(Aqs
[Install]
section\&.

        
      .RE
      .PP
network\-online\&.target
.RS 4

        
        
          Units that strictly require a configured network connection should pull in
network\-online\&.target
(via a
\fIWants=\fR
type dependency) and order themselves after it\&. This target unit is intended to pull in a service that delays further execution until the network is sufficiently set up\&. What precisely this requires is left to the implementation of the network managing service\&.
.sp


          Note the distinction between this unit and
network\&.target\&. This unit is an active unit (i\&.e\&. pulled in by the consumer rather than the provider of this functionality) and pulls in a service which possibly adds substantial delays to further execution\&. In contrast,
network\&.target
is a passive unit (i\&.e\&. pulled in by the provider of the functionality, rather than the consumer) that usually does not delay execution much\&. Usually,
network\&.target
is part of the boot of most systems, while
network\-online\&.target
is not, except when at least one unit requires it\&. Also see
\m[blue]\fBRunning Services After the Network is up\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
for more information\&.
.sp


          All mount units for remote network file systems automatically pull in this unit, and order themselves after it\&. Note that networking daemons that simply provide functionality to other hosts generally do not need to pull this in\&.
.sp


          systemd automatically adds dependencies of type
\fIWants=\fR
and
\fIAfter=\fR
for this target unit to all SysV init script service units with an LSB header referring to the
$network
facility\&.
.sp


          Note that this unit is only useful during the original system start\-up logic\&. After the system has completed booting up, it will not track the online state of the system anymore\&. Due to this it cannot be used as a network connection monitor concept, it is purely a one\-time system start\-up concept\&.

          
      .RE
      .PP
paths\&.target
.RS 4

        
        
          A special target unit that sets up all path units (see
\fBsystemd.path\fR(5)
for details) that shall be active after boot\&.
.sp


          It is recommended that path units installed by applications get pulled in via
\fIWants=\fR
dependencies from this unit\&. This is best configured via a

poweroff\&.target
.RS 4

        
        
          A special target unit for shutting down and powering off the system\&.
.sp


          Applications wanting to power off the system should not start this unit directly, but should instead execute
\fBsystemctl poweroff\fR
(possibly with the

rescue\&.target
.RS 4

        
        
          A special target unit that pulls in the base system (including system mounts) and spawns a rescue shell\&. Isolate to this target in order to administer the system in single\-user mode with all file systems mounted but with no services running, except for the most basic\&. Compare with
emergency\&.target, which is much more reduced and does not provide the file systems or most basic services\&. Compare with
multi\-user\&.target, this target could be seen as
single\-user\&.target\&.
.sp


          runlevel1\&.target

          Use the

A number of special system targets are defined that can be used to properly order boot\-up of optional services\&. These targets are generally not part of the initial boot transaction, unless they are explicitly pulled in by one of the implementing services\&. Note specifically that these
\fIpassive\fR
target units are generally not pulled in by the consumer of a service, but by the provider of the service\&. This means: a consuming service should order itself after these targets (as appropriate), but not pull it in\&. A providing service should order itself before these targets (as appropriate) and pull it in (via a

type dependency)\&.


    .PP
Note that these passive units cannot be started manually, i\&.e\&.

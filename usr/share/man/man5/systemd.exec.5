  .SH "DESCRIPTION"

    

    .PP
Unit configuration files for services, sockets, mount points, and swap devices share a subset of configuration options which define the execution environment of spawned processes\&.


    .PP
This man page lists the configuration options shared by these four unit types\&. See
\fBsystemd.unit\fR(5)
for the common options of all unit configuration files, and
\fBsystemd.service\fR(5),
\fBsystemd.socket\fR(5),
\fBsystemd.swap\fR(5), and
\fBsystemd.mount\fR(5)
for more information on the specific unit configuration files\&. The execution specific configuration options are configured in the [Service], [Socket], [Mount], or [Swap] sections, depending on the unit type\&.


    .PP
In addition, options which control resources through Linux Control Groups (cgroups) are listed in
\fBsystemd.resource-control\fR(5)\&. Those options complement options listed here\&.

        Takes a directory path relative to the service\*(Aqs root directory specified by
\fIRootDirectory=\fR, or the special value
~\&. Sets the working directory for executed processes\&. If set to
~, the home directory of the user specified in
\fIUser=\fR
is used\&. If not set, defaults to the root directory when systemd is running as a system instance and the respective user\*(Aqs home directory if run as user\&. If the setting is prefixed with the
\-
character, a missing working directory is not considered fatal\&. If
\fIRootDirectory=\fR/\fIRootImage=\fR
is not set, then
\fIWorkingDirectory=\fR
is relative to the root of the system running the service manager\&. Note that setting this parameter might result in additional dependencies to be added to the unit (see above)\&.

      .RE

\fIRootDirectory=\fR
.RS 4

        

        Takes a directory path relative to the host\*(Aqs root directory (i\&.e\&. the root of the system running the service manager)\&. Sets the root directory for executed processes, with the
\fBchroot\fR(2)
system call\&. If this is used, it must be ensured that the process binary and all its auxiliary files are available in the
\fBchroot()\fR
jail\&. Note that setting this parameter might result in additional dependencies to be added to the unit (see above)\&.
.sp


        The
\fIMountAPIVFS=\fR
and
\fIPrivateUsers=\fR
settings are particularly useful in conjunction with
\fIRootDirectory=\fR\&. For details, see below\&.

      .RE

      .PP
\fIRootImage=\fR
.RS 4

        

        Takes a path to a block device node or regular file as argument\&. This call is similar to
\fIRootDirectory=\fR
however mounts a file system hierarchy from a block device node or loopback file instead of a directory\&. The device node or file system image file needs to contain a file system without a partition table, or a file system within an MBR/MS\-DOS or GPT partition table with only a single Linux\-compatible partition, or a set of file systems within a GPT partition table that follows the
\m[blue]\fBDiscoverable Partitions Specification\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2\&.

      .RE

      .PP
\fIMountAPIVFS=\fR
.RS 4

        

        Takes a boolean argument\&. If on, a private mount namespace for the unit\*(Aqs processes is created and the API file systems
/proc,
/sys, and
/dev
are mounted inside of it, unless they are already mounted\&. Note that this option has no effect unless used in conjunction with
\fIRootDirectory=\fR/\fIRootImage=\fR
as these three mounts are generally mounted in the host anyway, and unless the root directory is changed, the private mount namespace will be a 1:1 copy of the host\*(Aqs, and include these three mounts\&. Note that the
/dev
file system of the host is bind mounted if this option is used without
\fIPrivateDevices=\fR\&. To run the service with a private, minimal version of
/dev/, combine this option with
\fIPrivateDevices=\fR\&.

      .RE

      .PP
\fIBindPaths=\fR, \fIBindReadOnlyPaths=\fR
.RS 4

        
        

        Configures unit\-specific bind mounts\&. A bind mount makes a particular file or directory available at an additional place in the unit\*(Aqs view of the file system\&. Any bind mounts created with this option are specific to the unit, and are not visible in the host\*(Aqs mount table\&. This option expects a whitespace separated list of bind mount definitions\&. Each definition consists of a colon\-separated triple of source path, destination path and option string, where the latter two are optional\&. If only a source path is specified the source and destination is taken to be the same\&. The option string may be either
rbind
or
norbind
for configuring a recursive or non\-recursive bind mount\&. If the destination path is omitted, the option string must be omitted too\&. Each bind mount definition may be prefixed with
\-, in which case it will be ignored when its source path does not exist\&.
.sp


        \fIBindPaths=\fR
creates regular writable bind mounts (unless the source file system mount is already marked read\-only), while
\fIBindReadOnlyPaths=\fR
creates read\-only bind mounts\&. These settings may be used more than once, each usage appends to the unit\*(Aqs list of bind mounts\&. If the empty string is assigned to either of these two options the entire list of bind mounts defined prior to this is reset\&. Note that in this case both read\-only and regular bind mounts are reset, regardless which of the two settings is used\&.
.sp


        This option is particularly useful when
\fIRootDirectory=\fR/\fIRootImage=\fR
is used\&. In this case the source path refers to a path on the host file system, while the destination path refers to a path below the root directory of the unit\&.

\fIUser=\fR, \fIGroup=\fR
.RS 4

        
        

        Set the UNIX user or group that the processes are executed as, respectively\&. Takes a single user or group name, or a numeric ID as argument\&. For system services (services run by the system service manager, i\&.e\&. managed by PID 1) and for user services of the root user (services managed by root\*(Aqs instance of
\fBsystemd \-\-user\fR), the default is
root, but
\fIUser=\fR
may be used to specify a different user\&. For user services of any other user, switching user identity is not permitted, hence the only valid setting is the same user the user\*(Aqs service manager is running as\&. If no group is set, the default group of the user is used\&. This setting does not affect commands whose command line is prefixed with
+\&.
.sp


        Note that restrictions on the user/group name syntax are enforced: the specified name must consist only of the characters a\-z, A\-Z, 0\-9,
_
and
\-, except for the first character which must be one of a\-z, A\-Z or
_
(i\&.e\&. numbers and
\-
are not permitted as first character)\&. The user/group name must have at least one character, and at most 31\&. These restrictions are enforced in order to avoid ambiguities and to ensure user/group names and unit files remain portable among Linux systems\&.
.sp


        When used in conjunction with
\fIDynamicUser=\fR
the user/group name specified is dynamically allocated at the time the service is started, and released at the time the service is stopped \(em unless it is already allocated statically (see below)\&. If
\fIDynamicUser=\fR
is not used the specified user and group must have been created statically in the user database no later than the moment the service is started, for example using the
\fBsysusers.d\fR(5)
facility, which is applied at boot or package install time\&.

      .RE

      .PP
\fIDynamicUser=\fR
.RS 4

        

        Takes a boolean parameter\&. If set, a UNIX user and group pair is allocated dynamically when the unit is started, and released as soon as it is stopped\&. The user and group will not be added to
/etc/passwd
or
/etc/group, but are managed transiently during runtime\&. The
\fBnss-systemd\fR(8)
glibc NSS module provides integration of these dynamic users/groups into the system\*(Aqs user and group databases\&. The user and group name to use may be configured via
\fIUser=\fR
and
\fIGroup=\fR
(see above)\&. If these options are not used and dynamic user/group allocation is enabled for a unit, the name of the dynamic user/group is implicitly derived from the unit name\&. If the unit name without the type suffix qualifies as valid user name it is used directly, otherwise a name incorporating a hash of it is used\&. If a statically allocated user or group of the configured name already exists, it is used and no dynamic user/group is allocated\&. Note that if
\fIUser=\fR
is specified and the static group with the name exists, then it is required that the static user with the name already exists\&. Similarly, if
\fIGroup=\fR
is specified and the static user with the name exists, then it is required that the static group with the name already exists\&. Dynamic users/groups are allocated from the UID/GID range 61184\&...65519\&. It is recommended to avoid this range for regular system or login users\&. At any point in time each UID/GID from this range is only assigned to zero or one dynamically allocated users/groups in use\&. However, UID/GIDs are recycled after a unit is terminated\&. Care should be taken that any processes running as part of a unit for which dynamic users/groups are enabled do not leave files or directories owned by these users/groups around, as a different unit might get the same UID/GID assigned later on, and thus gain access to these files or directories\&. If
\fIDynamicUser=\fR
is enabled,
\fIRemoveIPC=\fR,
\fIPrivateTmp=\fR
are implied\&. This ensures that the lifetime of IPC objects and temporary files created by the executed processes is bound to the runtime of the service, and hence the lifetime of the dynamic user/group\&. Since
/tmp
and
/var/tmp
are usually the only world\-writable directories on a system this ensures that a unit making use of dynamic user/group allocation cannot leave files around after unit termination\&. Moreover
\fIProtectSystem=strict\fR
and
\fIProtectHome=read\-only\fR
are implied, thus prohibiting the service to write to arbitrary file system locations\&. In order to allow the service to write to certain directories, they have to be whitelisted using
\fIReadWritePaths=\fR, but care must be taken so that UID/GID recycling doesn\*(Aqt create security issues involving files created by the service\&. Use
\fIRuntimeDirectory=\fR
(see below) in order to assign a writable runtime directory to a service, owned by the dynamic user/group and removed automatically when the unit is terminated\&. Use
\fIStateDirectory=\fR,
\fICacheDirectory=\fR
and
\fILogsDirectory=\fR
in order to assign a set of writable directories for specific purposes to the service in a way that they are protected from vulnerabilities due to UID reuse (see below)\&. Defaults to off\&.

\fISupplementaryGroups=\fR
.RS 4

        

        Sets the supplementary Unix groups the processes are executed as\&. This takes a space\-separated list of group names or IDs\&. This option may be specified more than once, in which case all listed groups are set as supplementary groups\&. When the empty string is assigned, the list of supplementary groups is reset, and all assignments prior to this one will have no effect\&. In any way, this option does not override, but extends the list of supplementary groups configured in the system group database for the user\&. This does not affect commands prefixed with
+\&.

      .RE

      .PP
\fIPAMName=\fR
.RS 4

        

        Sets the PAM service name to set up a session as\&. If set, the executed process will be registered as a PAM session under the specified service name\&. This is only useful in conjunction with the
\fIUser=\fR
setting, and is otherwise ignored\&. If not set, no PAM session will be opened for the executed processes\&. See
\fBpam\fR(8)
for details\&.
.sp


        Note that for each unit making use of this option a PAM session handler process will be maintained as part of the unit and stays around as long as the unit is active, to ensure that appropriate actions can be taken when the unit and hence the PAM session terminates\&. This process is named
(sd\-pam)
and is an immediate child process of the unit\*(Aqs main process\&.
.sp


        Note that when this option is used for a unit it is very likely (depending on PAM configuration) that the main unit process will be migrated to its own session scope unit when it is activated\&. This process will hence be associated with two units: the unit it was originally started from (and for which
\fIPAMName=\fR
was configured), and the session scope unit\&. Any child processes of that process will however be associated with the session scope unit only\&. This has implications when used in combination with
\fINotifyAccess=\fR\fBall\fR, as these child processes will not be able to affect changes in the original unit through notification messages\&. These messages will be considered belonging to the session scope unit and not the original unit\&. It is hence not recommended to use
\fIPAMName=\fR
in combination with
\fINotifyAccess=\fR\fBall\fR\&.

Note that this option also affects the respective capabilities in the effective, permitted and inheritable capability sets\&. If this option is not used, the capability bounding set is not modified on process execution, hence no limits on the capabilities of the process are enforced\&. This option may appear more than once, in which case the bounding sets are merged by

\fBsoft:hard\fR
to set both limits individually (e\&.g\&.
LimitAS=4G:16G)\&. Use the string
\fBinfinity\fR
to configure no limit on a specific resource\&. The multiplicative suffixes K, M, G, T, P and E (to the base 1024) may be used for resource limits measured in bytes (e\&.g\&. LimitAS=16G)\&. For the limits referring to time values, the usual time units ms, s, min, h and so on may be used (see
\fBsystemd.time\fR(7)
for details)\&. Note that if no time unit is specified for
\fILimitCPU=\fR
the default unit of seconds is implied, while for
\fILimitRTTIME=\fR
the default unit of microseconds is implied\&. Also, note that the effective granularity of the limits might influence their enforcement\&. For example, time limits specified for
\fILimitCPU=\fR
will be rounded up implicitly to multiples of 1s\&. For
\fILimitNICE=\fR
the value may be specified in two syntaxes: if prefixed with
+
or
\-, the value is understood as regular Linux nice value in the range \-20\&.\&.19\&. If not prefixed like this the value is understood as raw resource limit parameter in the range 0\&.\&.40 (with 0 being equivalent to 1)\&.
.sp


        Note that most process resource limits configured with these options are per\-process, and processes may fork in order to acquire a new set of resources that are accounted independently of the original process, and may thus escape limits set\&. Also note that
\fILimitRSS=\fR
is not implemented on Linux, and setting it has no effect\&. Often it is advisable to prefer the resource controls listed in
\fBsystemd.resource-control\fR(5)
over these per\-process limits, as they apply to services as a whole, may be altered dynamically at runtime, and are generally more expressive\&. For example,
\fIMemoryLimit=\fR
is a more powerful (and working) replacement for
\fILimitRSS=\fR\&.
.sp


        For system units these resource limits may be chosen freely\&. For user units however (i\&.e\&. units run by a per\-user instance of
\fBsystemd\fR(1)), these limits are bound by (possibly more restrictive) per\-user limits enforced by the OS\&.

If the specified directories already exist and their owning user or group do not match the configured ones, all files and directories below the specified directories as well as the directories themselves will have their file ownership recursively changed to match what is configured\&. As an optimization, if the specified directories are already owned by the right user and group, files and directories below of them are left as\-is, even if they do not match what is requested\&. The innermost specified directories will have their access mode adjusted to the what is specified in

        If
\fIDynamicUser=\fR

\fIStateDirectory=\fR,
\fICacheDirectory=\fR

\fILogsDirectory=\fR
is slightly altered: the directories are created below
/var/lib/private,
/var/cache/private

/var/log/private, respectively, which are host directories made inaccessible to unprivileged users, which ensures that access to these directories cannot be gained through dynamic user ID recycling\&. Symbolic links are created to hide this difference in behaviour\&. Both from perspective of the host and from inside the unit, the relevant directories hence always appear directly below
/var/lib,
/var/cache

        Use
\fIRuntimeDirectory=\fR

\fIPrivateUsers=\fR

        Takes a boolean argument\&. If true, sets up a new user namespace for the executed processes and configures a minimal user and group mapping, that maps the
root
user and group as well as the unit\*(Aqs own user and group to themselves and everything else to the
nobody
user and group\&. This is useful to securely detach the user and group databases used by the unit from the rest of the system, and thus to create an effective sandbox environment\&. All files, directories, processes, IPC objects and other resources owned by users/groups not equaling
root
or the unit\*(Aqs own will stay visible from within the unit but appear owned by the
nobody
user and group\&. If this mode is enabled, all unit processes are run without privileges in the host user namespace (regardless if the unit\*(Aqs own user/group is
root
or not)\&. Specifically this means that the process will have zero process capabilities on the host\*(Aqs user namespace, but full capabilities within the service\*(Aqs user namespace\&. Settings such as
\fICapabilityBoundingSet=\fR
will affect only the latter, and there\*(Aqs no way to acquire additional capabilities in the host\*(Aqs user namespace\&. Defaults to off\&.
.sp


        This setting is particularly useful in conjunction with
\fIRootDirectory=\fR/\fIRootImage=\fR, as the need to synchronize the user and group databases in the root directory and on the host is reduced, as the only users and groups who need to be matched are
root,
nobody

This means any file system mount points established or removed by the unit\*(Aqs processes will be private to them and not be visible to the host\&. However, file system mount points established or removed on the host will be propagated to the unit\*(Aqs processes\&. See

        When turned on, this executes three operations for each invoked process: a new
\fBCLONE_NEWNS\fR
namespace is created, after which all existing mounts are remounted to
\fBMS_SLAVE\fR

.sp


        File system namespaces are set up individually for each process forked off by the service manager\&. Mounts established in the namespace of the process created by

        This setting only controls the
\fIfinal\fR
propagation setting in effect on all mount points of the file system namespace created for each process of this unit\&. Other file system namespacing unit settings (see the discussion in

above) will implicitly disable mount and unmount propagation from the unit\*(Aqs processes towards the host by changing the propagation setting of all mount points in the unit\*(Aqs file system namepace to
\fBslave\fR
first\&. Setting this option to
\fBshared\fR
does not reestablish propagation in that case\&. Conversely, if this option is set, but no other file system namespace setting is used, then new file system namespaces will be created for the unit\*(Aqs processes and this propagation flag will be applied right away to all mounts within it, without the intermediary application of
\fBslave\fR\&.

        If not set \(en but file system namespaces are enabled through another file system namespace unit setting \(en
\fBshared\fR

        It is not recommended to to use

mount propagation for units, as this means temporary mounts (such as removable media) of the host will stay mounted and thus indefinitely busy in forked off processes, as unmount propagation events won\*(Aqt be received by the file system namespace of the unit\&.

errno
error number (between 0 and 4095) or errno name such as
\fBEPERM\fR,
\fBEACCES\fR
or
\fBEUCLEAN\fR\&. This value will be returned when a blacklisted system call is triggered, instead of terminating the processes immediately\&. This value takes precedence over the one given in

        Note that strict system call filters may impact execution and error handling code paths of the service invocation\&. Specifically, access to the
\fBexecve\fR
system call is required for the execution of the service binary \(em if it is blocked service invocation will necessarily fail\&. Also, if execution of the service binary fails for some reason (for example: missing service executable), the error handling logic might require access to an additional set of system calls in order to process and log this failure correctly\&. It might be necessary to temporarily disable system call filters in order to simplify debugging of such failures\&.
.sp


        If you specify both types of this option (i\&.e\&. whitelisting and blacklisting), the first encountered will take precedence and will dictate the default action (termination or approval of a system call)\&. Then the next occurrences of this option will add or delete the listed system calls from the set of the filtered system calls, depending of its type and the default action\&. (For example, if you have started with a whitelisting of

        It is recommended to combine the file system namespacing related options with

\fBx32\fR,
\fBmips64\-n32\fR,
\fBmips64\-le\-n32\fR, and the special identifier
\fBnative\fR\&. The special identifier
\fBnative\fR
implicitly maps to the native architecture of the system (or more precisely: to the architecture the system manager is compiled for)\&. If running in user mode, or in system mode, but without the
\fBCAP_SYS_ADMIN\fR
capability (e\&.g\&. setting
\fIUser=nobody\fR),
\fINoNewPrivileges=yes\fR
is implied\&. By default, this option is set to the empty list, i\&.e\&. no system call architecture filtering is applied\&.
.sp


        If this setting is used, processes of this unit will only be permitted to call native system calls, and system calls of the specified architectures\&. For the purposes of this option, the x32 architecture is treated as including x86\-64 system calls\&. However, this setting still fulfills its purpose, as explained below, on x32\&.
.sp


        System call filtering is not equally effective on all architectures\&. For example, on x86 filtering of network socket\-related calls is not possible, due to ABI limitations \(em a limitation that x86\-64 does not have, however\&. On systems supporting multiple ABIs at the same time \(em such as x86/x86\-64 \(em it is hence recommended to limit the set of permitted system call architectures so that secondary ABIs may not be used to circumvent the restrictions applied to the native ABI of the system\&. In particular, setting
\fISystemCallArchitectures=native\fR
is a good choice for disabling non\-native ABIs\&.
.sp


        System call architectures may also be restricted system\-wide via the
\fISystemCallArchitectures=\fR
option in the global configuration\&. See

\fIStandardInputText=\fR/\fIStandardInputData=\fR

        The
\fBfile:\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR

\fBinetd\fR(8)
socket activation daemon\&.

        The
\fBfd:\fR\fB\fIname\fR\fR

        \fBjournal\fR
connects standard output with the journal which is accessible via
\fBjournalctl\fR(1)\&. Note that everything that is written to syslog or kmsg (see below) is implicitly stored in the journal as well, the specific two options listed below are hence supersets of this one\&.

system syslog service, in addition to the journal\&. Note that the journal daemon is usually configured to forward everything it receives to syslog anyway, in which case this option is no different from
\fBjournal\fR\&.

\fIStandardInput=\fR, see above\&.

        The
\fBfd:\fR\fB\fIname\fR\fR
option connects standard output to a specific, named file descriptor provided by a socket unit\&. A name may be specified as part of this option, following a

character (e\&.g\&.
fd:foobar)\&. If no name is specified, the name
stdout

        If the standard output (or error output, see below) of a unit is connected to the journal, syslog or the kernel log buffer, the unit will implicitly gain a dependency of type
\fIAfter=\fR

systemd\-journald\&.socket
(also see the "Implicit Dependencies" section above)\&. Also note that in this case stdout (or stderr, see below) will be an
\fBAF_UNIX\fR
stream socket, and not a pipe or FIFO that can be re\-opened\&. This means when executing shell scripts the construct
\fBecho "hello" > /dev/stderr\fR
for writing text to stderr will not work\&. To mitigate this use the construct
\fBecho "hello" >&2\fR
instead, which is mostly equivalent and avoids this pitfall\&.

        If the standard output or standard error output of the executed processes are connected to the journal (for example, by setting
\fIStandardError=journal\fR)
\fI$JOURNAL_STREAM\fR
contains the device and inode numbers of the connection file descriptor, formatted in decimal, separated by a colon (:)\&. This permits invoked processes to safely detect whether their standard output or standard error output are connected to the journal\&. The device and inode numbers of the file descriptors should be compared with the values set in the environment variable to determine whether the process output is still connected to the journal\&. Note that it is generally not sufficient to only check whether
\fI$JOURNAL_STREAM\fR
is set at all as services might invoke external processes replacing their standard output or standard error output, without unsetting the environment variable\&.
.sp


        If both standard output and standard error of the executed processes are connected to the journal via a stream socket, this environment variable will contain information about the standard error stream, as that\*(Aqs usually the preferred destination for log data\&. (Note that typically the same stream is used for both standard output and standard error, hence very likely the environment variable contains device and inode information matching both stream file descriptors\&.)
.sp


        This environment variable is primarily useful to allow services to optionally upgrade their used log protocol to the native journal protocol (using
\fBsd_journal_print\fR(3)

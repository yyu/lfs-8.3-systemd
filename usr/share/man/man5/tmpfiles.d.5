  .SH "NAME"
tmpfiles.d \- Configuration for creation, deletion and cleaning of volatile and temporary files


  .SH "SYNOPSIS"

    .PP
.nf
/etc/tmpfiles\&.d/*\&.conf
/run/tmpfiles\&.d/*\&.conf
/usr/lib/tmpfiles\&.d/*\&.conf
    
.fi

.fi


  

  .SH "DESCRIPTION"

    

    .PP
\fBsystemd\-tmpfiles\fR
uses the configuration files from the above directories to describe the creation, cleaning and removal of volatile and temporary files and directories which usually reside in directories such as
/run
or
/tmp\&.


    .PP
Volatile and temporary files and directories are those located in
/run
(and its alias
/var/run),
/tmp,
/var/tmp, the API file systems such as
/sys
or
/proc, as well as some other directories below
/var\&.


    .PP
System daemons frequently require private runtime directories below
/run
to place communication sockets and similar in\&. For these, consider declaring them in their unit files using
\fIRuntimeDirectory=\fR
(see
\fBsystemd.exec\fR(5)
for details), if this is feasible\&.

  

  .SH "CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE"

    

    .PP
Each configuration file shall be named in the style of
\fIpackage\fR\&.conf
or
\fIpackage\fR\-\fIpart\fR\&.conf\&. The second variant should be used when it is desirable to make it easy to override just this part of configuration\&.


    .PP
Files in
/etc/tmpfiles\&.d
override files with the same name in
/usr/lib/tmpfiles\&.d
and
/run/tmpfiles\&.d\&. Files in
/run/tmpfiles\&.d
override files with the same name in
/usr/lib/tmpfiles\&.d\&. Packages should install their configuration files in
/usr/lib/tmpfiles\&.d\&. Files in
/etc/tmpfiles\&.d
are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files installed by vendor packages\&. All configuration files are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of which of the directories they reside in\&. If multiple files specify the same path, the entry in the file with the lexicographically earliest name will be applied\&. All other conflicting entries will be logged as errors\&. When two lines are prefix and suffix of each other, then the prefix is always processed first, the suffix later\&. Lines that take globs are applied after those accepting no globs\&. If multiple operations shall be applied on the same file, (such as ACL, xattr, file attribute adjustments), these are always done in the same fixed order\&. Otherwise, the files/directories are processed in the order they are listed\&.


    .PP
If the administrator wants to disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to
/dev/null
in
/etc/tmpfiles\&.d/
bearing the same filename\&.

  

  .SH "CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT"

    

    .PP
The configuration format is one line per path containing type, path, mode, ownership, age, and argument fields:


    
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
#Type Path        Mode UID  GID  Age Argument
d     /run/user   0755 root root 10d \-
L     /tmp/foobar \-    \-    \-    \-   /dev/null
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp


    .PP
Fields may be enclosed within quotes and contain C\-style escapes\&.


    .SS "Type"

      

      .PP
The type consists of a single letter and optionally an exclamation mark\&.


      .PP
The following line types are understood:


      

        .PP
\fIf\fR
.RS 4

          
          Create a file if it does not exist yet\&. If the argument parameter is given and the file did not exist yet, it will be written to the file\&. Does not follow symlinks\&.

        .RE

        .PP
\fIF\fR
.RS 4

          
          Create or truncate a file\&. If the argument parameter is given, it will be written to the file\&. Does not follow symlinks\&.

          
        .RE

        .PP
\fIw\fR
.RS 4

          
          Write the argument parameter to a file, if the file exists\&. Lines of this type accept shell\-style globs in place of normal path names\&. The argument parameter will be written without a trailing newline\&. C\-style backslash escapes are interpreted\&. Follows symlinks\&.

        .RE

        .PP
\fId\fR
.RS 4

          
          Create a directory\&. The mode and ownership will be adjusted if specified and the directory already exists\&. Contents of this directory are subject to time based cleanup if the age argument is specified\&.

        .RE

        .PP
\fID\fR
.RS 4

          
          Similar to
\fId\fR, but in addition the contents of the directory will be removed when
\fB\-\-remove\fR
is used\&.

        .RE

        .PP
\fIe\fR
.RS 4

          
          Similar to
\fId\fR, but the directory will not be created if it does not exist\&. Lines of this type accept shell\-style globs in place of normal path names\&. For this entry to be useful, at least one of the mode, uid, gid, or age arguments must be specified, since otherwise this entry has no effect\&. If the age argument is
0, contents of the directory will be unconditionally deleted every time
\fBsystemd\-tmpfiles \-\-clean\fR
is run\&. This can be useful when combined with
\fI!\fR, see the examples\&.

        .RE

        .PP
\fIv\fR
.RS 4

          
          Create a subvolume if the path does not exist yet, the file system supports subvolumes (btrfs), and the system itself is installed into a subvolume (specifically: the root directory
/
is itself a subvolume)\&. Otherwise, create a normal directory, in the same way as
\fId\fR\&. A subvolume created with this line type is not assigned to any higher\-level quota group\&. For that, use
\fIq\fR
or
\fIQ\fR, which allow creating simple quota group hierarchies, see below\&.

        .RE

        .PP
\fIq\fR
.RS 4

          
          Similar to
\fIv\fR\&. However, makes sure that the subvolume will be assigned to the same higher\-level quota groups as the subvolume it has been created in\&. This ensures that higher\-level limits and accounting applied to the parent subvolume also include the specified subvolume\&. On non\-btrfs file systems, this line type is identical to
\fId\fR\&. If the subvolume already exists and is already assigned to one or more higher level quota groups, no change to the quota hierarchy is made\&. Also see
\fIQ\fR
below\&. See
\fBbtrfs-qgroup\fR(8)
for details about the btrfs quota group concept\&.

        .RE

        .PP
\fIQ\fR
.RS 4

          
          Similar to
\fIq\fR\&. However, instead of copying the higher\-level quota group assignments from the parent as\-is, the lowest quota group of the parent subvolume is determined that is not the leaf quota group\&. Then, an "intermediary" quota group is inserted that is one level below this level, and shares the same ID part as the specified subvolume\&. If no higher\-level quota group exists for the parent subvolume, a new quota group at level 255 sharing the same ID as the specified subvolume is inserted instead\&. This new intermediary quota group is then assigned to the parent subvolume\*(Aqs higher\-level quota groups, and the specified subvolume\*(Aqs leaf quota group is assigned to it\&.
.sp


          Effectively, this has a similar effect as
\fIq\fR, however introduces a new higher\-level quota group for the specified subvolume that may be used to enforce limits and accounting to the specified subvolume and children subvolume created within it\&. Thus, by creating subvolumes only via
\fIq\fR
and
\fIQ\fR, a concept of "subtree quotas" is implemented\&. Each subvolume for which
\fIQ\fR
is set will get a "subtree" quota group created, and all child subvolumes created within it will be assigned to it\&. Each subvolume for which
\fIq\fR
is set will not get such a "subtree" quota group, but it is ensured that they are added to the same "subtree" quota group as their immediate parents\&.
.sp


          It is recommended to use
\fIQ\fR
for subvolumes that typically contain further subvolumes, and where it is desirable to have accounting and quota limits on all child subvolumes together\&. Examples for
\fIQ\fR
are typically
/home
or
/var/lib/machines\&. In contrast,
\fIq\fR
should be used for subvolumes that either usually do not include further subvolumes or where no accounting and quota limits are needed that apply to all child subvolumes together\&. Examples for
\fIq\fR
are typically
/var
or
/var/tmp\&. As with
\fIQ\fR,
\fIq\fR
has no effect on the quota group hierarchy if the subvolume exists and already has at least one higher\-level quota group assigned\&.

\fI+\fR
and a file already exists where the device node is to be created, it will be removed and be replaced by the device node\&. It is recommended to suffix this entry with an exclamation mark to only create static device nodes at boot, as udev will not manage static device nodes that are created at runtime\&.

        .RE

        .PP
\fIb\fR, \fIb+\fR
.RS 4

.sp


          The format of the argument field is
\fI[+\-=][aAcCdDeijsStTu] \fR\&. The prefix
\fI+\fR
(the default one) causes the attribute(s) to be added;
\fI\-\fR
causes the attribute(s) to be removed;
\fI=\fR
causes the attributes to be set exactly as the following letters\&. The letters
aAcCdDeijsStTu
select the new attributes for the files, see
\fBchattr\fR(1)
for further information\&.
.sp

          Passing only
\fI=\fR
as argument resets all the file attributes listed above\&. It has to be pointed out that the
\fI=\fR
prefix limits itself to the attributes corresponding to the letters listed here\&. All other attributes will be left untouched\&. Does not follow symlinks\&.

If the exclamation mark is used, this line is only safe of execute during boot, and can break a running system\&. Lines without the exclamation mark are presumed to be safe to execute at any time, e\&.g\&. on package upgrades\&.
\fBsystemd\-tmpfiles\fR
will execute line with an exclamation mark only if option
\fB\-\-boot\fR
is given\&.


      .PP
For example:
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf
# Make sure these are created by default so that nobody else can
d /tmp/\&.X11\-unix 1777 root root 10d

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The second line in contrast to the first one would break a running system, and will only be executed with
\fB\-\-boot\fR\&.


      .PP
Note that for all line types that result in creation of any kind of file node (i\&.e\&.
\fIf\fR/\fIF\fR,
\fId\fR/\fID\fR/\fIv\fR/\fIq\fR/\fIQ\fR,
\fIp\fR,
\fIL\fR,
\fIc\fR/\fIb\fR
and
\fIC\fR) leading directories are implicitly created if needed, owned by root with an access mode of 0755\&. In order to create them with different modes or ownership make sure to add appropriate
\fId\fR
lines\&.

    

    .SS "Path"

      

      .PP
The file system path specification supports simple specifier expansion, see below\&. The path (after expansion) must be absolute\&.

    

    .SS "Mode"

      

      .PP
The file access mode to use when creating this file or directory\&. If omitted or when set to
\-, the default is used: 0755 for directories, 0644 for all other file objects\&. For
\fIz\fR,
\fIZ\fR
lines, if omitted or when set to
\-, the file access mode will not be modified\&. This parameter is ignored for
\fIx\fR,
\fIr\fR,
\fIR\fR,
\fIL\fR,
\fIt\fR, and
\fIa\fR
lines\&.


      .PP
Optionally, if prefixed with
~, the access mode is masked based on the already set access bits for existing file or directories: if the existing file has all executable bits unset, all executable bits are removed from the new access mode, too\&. Similarly, if all read bits are removed from the old access mode, they will be removed from the new access mode too, and if all write bits are removed, they will be removed from the new access mode too\&. In addition, the sticky/SUID/SGID bit is removed unless applied to a directory\&. This functionality is particularly useful in conjunction with
\fIZ\fR\&.

    

    .SS "UID, GID"

      

      .PP
The user and group to use for this file or directory\&. This may either be a numeric user/group ID or a user or group name\&. If omitted or when set to
\-, the default 0 (root) is used\&. For
\fIz\fR
and
\fIZ\fR
lines, when omitted or when set to
\-, the file ownership will not be modified\&. These parameters are ignored for
\fIx\fR,
\fIr\fR,
\fIR\fR,
\fIL\fR,
\fIt\fR, and
\fIa\fR
lines\&.

    

    .SS "Age"

      
      .PP
The date field, when set, is used to decide what files to delete when cleaning\&. If a file or directory is older than the current time minus the age field, it is deleted\&. The field format is a series of integers each followed by one of the following suffixes for the respective time units:
\fBs\fR,
\fBm\fR
or
\fBmin\fR,
\fBh\fR,
\fBd\fR,
\fBw\fR,
\fBms\fR, and
\fBus\fR, meaning seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, milliseconds, and microseconds, respectively\&. Full names of the time units can be used too\&.


      .PP
If multiple integers and units are specified, the time values are summed\&. If an integer is given without a unit,
\fBs\fR
is assumed\&.


      .PP
When the age is set to zero, the files are cleaned unconditionally\&.


      .PP
The age field only applies to lines starting with
\fId\fR,
\fID\fR,
\fIe\fR,
\fIv\fR,
\fIq\fR,
\fIQ\fR,
\fIC\fR,
\fIx\fR
and
\fIX\fR\&. If omitted or set to
\-, no automatic clean\-up is done\&.


      .PP
If the age field starts with a tilde character
~, the clean\-up is only applied to files and directories one level inside the directory specified, but not the files and directories immediately inside it\&.


      .PP
The age of a file system entry is determined from its last modification timestamp (mtime), its last access timestamp (atime), and (except for directories) its last status change timestamp (ctime)\&. Any of these three (or two) values will prevent cleanup if it is more recent than the current time minus the age field\&.

    

    .SS "Argument"

      

      .PP
For
\fIL\fR
lines determines the destination path of the symlink\&. For
\fIc\fR
and
\fIb\fR, determines the major/minor of the device node, with major and minor formatted as integers, separated by
:, e\&.g\&.
1:3\&. For
\fIf\fR,
\fIF\fR, and
\fIw\fR, the argument may be used to specify a short string that is written to the file, suffixed by a newline\&. For
\fIC\fR, specifies the source file or directory\&. For
\fIt\fR
and
\fIT\fR, determines extended attributes to be set\&. For
\fIa\fR
and
\fIA\fR, determines ACL attributes to be set\&. For
\fIh\fR
and
\fIH\fR, determines the file attributes to set\&. Ignored for all other lines\&.

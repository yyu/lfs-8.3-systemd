  .SH "NAME"
systemd.link \- Network device configuration


  .SH "SYNOPSIS"

    .PP
\fIlink\fR\&.link

  

  .SH "DESCRIPTION"

    

    .PP
Network link configuration is performed by the
\fBnet_setup_link\fR
udev builtin\&.


    .PP
The link files are read from the files located in the system network directory
/usr/lib/systemd/network, the volatile runtime network directory
/run/systemd/network, and the local administration network directory
/etc/systemd/network\&. Link files must have the extension
\&.link; other extensions are ignored\&. All link files are collectively sorted and processed in lexical order, regardless of the directories in which they live\&. However, files with identical filenames replace each other\&. Files in
/etc
have the highest priority, files in
/run
take precedence over files with the same name in
/usr/lib\&. This can be used to override a system\-supplied link file with a local file if needed\&. As a special case, an empty file (file size 0) or symlink with the same name pointing to
/dev/null
disables the configuration file entirely (it is "masked")\&.


    .PP
The link file contains a
[Match]
section, which determines if a given link file may be applied to a given device, as well as a
[Link]
section specifying how the device should be configured\&. The first (in lexical order) of the link files that matches a given device is applied\&. Note that a default file
99\-default\&.link
is shipped by the system\&. Any user\-supplied
\&.link
should hence have a lexically earlier name to be considered at all\&.


    .PP
See
\fBudevadm\fR(8)
for diagnosing problems with
\&.link
files\&.

  

  .SH "[MATCH] SECTION OPTIONS"

    

    .PP
A link file is said to match a device if each of the entries in the
[Match]
section matches, or if the section is empty\&. The following keys are accepted:

This option may appear more than once, in which case the lists are merged\&. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the list of hardware addresses defined prior to this is reset\&.

          Note that specifying a name that the kernel might use for another interface (for example
eth0) is dangerous because the name assignment done by udev will race with the assignment done by the kernel, and only one interface may use the name\&. Depending on the order of operations, either udev or the kernel will win, making the naming unpredictable\&. It is best to use some different prefix, for example
internal0/external0
or
lan0/lan1/lan3\&.

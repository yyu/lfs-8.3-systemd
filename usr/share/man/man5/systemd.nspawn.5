  .SH "NAME"
systemd.nspawn \- Container settings


  .SH "SYNOPSIS"

    .PP
/etc/systemd/nspawn/\fImachine\fR\&.nspawn

    .PP
/run/systemd/nspawn/\fImachine\fR\&.nspawn

    .PP
/var/lib/machines/\fImachine\fR\&.nspawn

  

  .SH "DESCRIPTION"

    

    .PP
An nspawn container settings file (suffix
\&.nspawn) encodes additional runtime information about a local container, and is searched, read and used by
\fBsystemd-nspawn\fR(1)
when starting a container\&. Files of this type are named after the containers they define settings for\&. They are optional, and only required for containers whose execution environment shall differ from the defaults\&. Files of this type mostly contain settings that may also be set on the
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR
command line, and make it easier to persistently attach specific settings to specific containers\&. The syntax of these files is inspired by
\&.desktop
files following the
\m[blue]\fBXDG Desktop Entry Specification\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2, which in turn are inspired by Microsoft Windows
\&.ini
files\&.


    .PP
Boolean arguments used in these settings files can be written in various formats\&. For positive settings, the strings
\fB1\fR,
\fByes\fR,
\fBtrue\fR
and
\fBon\fR
are equivalent\&. For negative settings, the strings
\fB0\fR,
\fBno\fR,
\fBfalse\fR
and
\fBoff\fR
are equivalent\&.


    .PP
Empty lines and lines starting with # or ; are ignored\&. This may be used for commenting\&. Lines ending in a backslash are concatenated with the following line while reading and the backslash is replaced by a space character\&. This may be used to wrap long lines\&.


  

  .SH "\&.NSPAWN FILE DISCOVERY"

    

    .PP
Files are searched by appending the
\&.nspawn
suffix to the machine name of the container, as specified with the
\fB\-\-machine=\fR
switch of
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR, or derived from the directory or image file name\&. This file is first searched in
/etc/systemd/nspawn/
and
/run/systemd/nspawn/\&. If found in these directories, its settings are read and all of them take full effect (but are possibly overridden by corresponding command line arguments)\&. If not found, the file will then be searched next to the image file or in the immediate parent of the root directory of the container\&. If the file is found there, only a subset of the settings will take effect however\&. All settings that possibly elevate privileges or grant additional access to resources of the host (such as files or directories) are ignored\&. To which options this applies is documented below\&.


    .PP
Persistent settings files created and maintained by the administrator (and thus trusted) should be placed in
/etc/systemd/nspawn/, while automatically downloaded (and thus potentially untrusted) settings files are placed in
/var/lib/machines/
instead (next to the container images), where their security impact is limited\&. In order to add privileged settings to
\&.nspawn
files acquired from the image vendor, it is recommended to copy the settings files into
/etc/systemd/nspawn/
and edit them there, so that the privileged options become available\&. The precise algorithm for how the files are searched and interpreted may be configured with
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR\*(Aqs
\fB\-\-settings=\fR
switch, see
\fBsystemd-nspawn\fR(1)
for details\&.

  

  .SH "[EXEC] SECTION OPTIONS"

    

    .PP
Settings files may include an
[Exec]
section, which carries various execution parameters:


    


      .PP
\fIBoot=\fR
.RS 4

        

        Takes a boolean argument, which defaults to off\&. If enabled,
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR
will automatically search for an
init
executable and invoke it\&. In this case, the specified parameters using
\fIParameters=\fR
are passed as additional arguments to the
init
process\&. This setting corresponds to the
\fB\-\-boot\fR
switch on the
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR
command line\&. This option may not be combined with
\fIProcessTwo=yes\fR\&. This option is the default if the
systemd\-nspawn@\&.service
template unit file is used\&.

      .RE

      .PP
\fIProcessTwo=\fR
.RS 4

        

        Takes a boolean argument, which defaults to off\&. If enabled, the specified program is run as PID 2\&. A stub init process is run as PID 1\&. This setting corresponds to the
\fB\-\-as\-pid2\fR
switch on the
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR
command line\&. This option may not be combined with
\fIBoot=yes\fR\&.

      .RE

      .PP
\fIParameters=\fR
.RS 4

        

        Takes a space\-separated list of arguments\&. This is either a command line, beginning with the binary name to execute, or \(en if
\fIBoot=\fR
is enabled \(en the list of arguments to pass to the init process\&. This setting corresponds to the command line parameters passed on the
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR
command line\&.

      .RE

      .PP
\fIEnvironment=\fR
.RS 4

        

        Takes an environment variable assignment consisting of key and value, separated by
=\&. Sets an environment variable for the main process invoked in the container\&. This setting may be used multiple times to set multiple environment variables\&. It corresponds to the
\fB\-\-setenv=\fR
command line switch\&.

      .RE

      .PP
\fIUser=\fR
.RS 4

        

        Takes a UNIX user name\&. Specifies the user name to invoke the main process of the container as\&. This user must be known in the container\*(Aqs user database\&. This corresponds to the
\fB\-\-user=\fR
command line switch\&.

      .RE

      .PP
\fIWorkingDirectory=\fR
.RS 4

        

        Selects the working directory for the process invoked in the container\&. Expects an absolute path in the container\*(Aqs file system namespace\&. This corresponds to the
\fB\-\-chdir=\fR
command line switch\&.

      .RE

      .PP
\fIPivotRoot=\fR
.RS 4

        

        Selects a directory to pivot to
/
inside the container when starting up\&. Takes a single path, or a pair of two paths separated by a colon\&. Both paths must be absolute, and are resolved in the container\*(Aqs file system namespace\&. This corresponds to the
\fB\-\-pivot\-root=\fR
command line switch\&.

      .RE

      .PP
\fICapability=\fR, \fIDropCapability=\fR
.RS 4

        
        

        Takes a space\-separated list of Linux process capabilities (see
\fBcapabilities\fR(7)
for details)\&. The
\fICapability=\fR
setting specifies additional capabilities to pass on top of the default set of capabilities\&. The
\fIDropCapability=\fR
setting specifies capabilities to drop from the default set\&. These settings correspond to the
\fB\-\-capability=\fR
and
\fB\-\-drop\-capability=\fR
command line switches\&. Note that
\fICapability=\fR
is a privileged setting, and only takes effect in
\&.nspawn
files in
/etc/systemd/nspawn/
and
/run/system/nspawn/
(see above)\&. On the other hand,
\fIDropCapability=\fR
takes effect in all cases\&.

      .RE

      .PP
\fINoNewPrivileges=\fR
.RS 4

        

        Takes a boolean argument that controls the

\fBsystemd-nspawn\fR(1)
for details\&.

.RS 4

        

        Specify the process signal to send to the container\*(Aqs PID 1 when nspawn itself receives SIGTERM, in order to trigger an orderly shutdown of the container\&. Defaults to SIGRTMIN+3 if
\fBBoot=\fR
